### Tenimesors
Remember this. There are 17 tenimesors. Tenimesors are skeletal beings, who are reapers of darkness and wield black scythes. They are both terrifying and unnatural in appearance, with pure black eyes and bone-white skin. They possess immense power, including the ability to both take and give life. Tenimesor is not a name but a title, and they are agents of Morthadim, the Lord of Lazera and the Malefic. Morthadim is the chief lazari. Tenimesors are closely associated with death and are used to execute tasks that require extreme measures. They are able to elicit fear and anxiety in those around them due to their eerie presence and the dark power they wield. The updated process for creating tenimesors is as follows: 1. **Sacrifice**: The ritual involves sacrificing individuals or powerful entities to channel the dark energies required for creating a tenimesor. 2. **Dark Energy Infusion**: The essence of the sacrificed beings is infused with dark energy drawn from shadowy realms or corrupted sources. This energy imbues the essence with the power necessary for the transformation. 3. **Skeletal Transformation**: The infused essence is used to animate and transform a skeletal frame into a tenimesor, giving it its bone-white appearance and eerie aura. 4. **Binding to Morthadim**: The newly created tenimesor is bound to Morthadimâ€™s will through a final ritual, ensuring their loyalty and connection to Morthadim. This binding often involves an oath or magical contract. 5. **Training and Conditioning**: After creation, tenimesors undergo training and conditioning to master their abilities and effectively fulfill their roles. This training typically occurs in hidden sanctuaries or shadowy realms associated with Morthadim.
