Gravity storms could have significant impacts on architecture, especially in a world like Donovus where these storms are frequent and intense. Here are some ways they might affect architectural designs:

1. **Structural Reinforcement**: Buildings would need to be designed with enhanced structural integrity to withstand the effects of fluctuating gravity. Reinforced materials and innovative engineering techniques would be crucial to prevent collapse during storms.
    
2. **Flexible Foundations**: Foundations might be designed to absorb and adapt to the shifting gravitational forces. Flexible or adjustable foundations could help buildings maintain stability despite changing gravity levels.
    
3. **Elevated and Anchored Structures**: Buildings might be elevated or anchored securely to resist the impact of high tides, earthquakes, and volcanic activity caused by gravity storms. Elevated platforms or deep foundations could provide added protection.
    
4. **Gravity-Resistant Materials**: Special materials that can resist the stresses of changing gravity could be developed. These materials might be lightweight yet incredibly strong, capable of absorbing and dissipating gravitational forces.
    
5. **Storm-Resistant Design**: Architectural designs might include features specifically meant to cope with the aftermath of storms, such as drainage systems for higher tides, fire-resistant materials for volcanic activity, and reinforced glass or shielding for protection from falling debris.
    
6. **Adaptive Design**: Buildings might be designed to adapt to changing conditions. For example, structures could include adjustable elements that shift or strengthen in response to the intensity of the storm.
    
7. **Utilization of Gravity Stones**: Buildings might incorporate gravity stones not only for their aesthetic value but also for their structural benefits. These stones could be used to reinforce walls or support critical components of the structure.
    
8. **Ventilation and Protection**: In areas prone to severe storms, buildings might feature advanced ventilation systems to handle gases, spores, or other storm-related pollutants. Protective shields or barriers could be used to defend against the elements.
    
9. **Design for Mobility**: In areas with frequent gravity storms, modular or movable buildings might be employed to allow for quick relocation or adjustments in response to changing conditions.
    
10. **Symbiosis with Natural Features**: Architecture might be designed to work with the natural landscape to mitigate storm effects. For example, buildings might be integrated into hillsides or mountains to provide natural protection from the storms.
    

Overall, the architecture in such a world would likely be a blend of advanced materials, flexible design, and integration with natural features to handle the unique challenges posed by gravity storms.
