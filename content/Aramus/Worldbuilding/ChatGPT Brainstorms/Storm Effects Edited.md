From [[Storms Effects]]
# Soveldas
Korrin stood at the edge of the village, watching as the Soveldas rolled in. The storm was a looming shadow on the horizon, its dark, swirling clouds laced with a peculiar indigo hue. Beneath the clouds, a thick fog spread out, slowly creeping toward them like a predator stalking its prey.

The air grew heavy as the first drops of rain fell, cool and sharp against Korrin’s skin. He felt the twinge in his chest, a subtle pressure that reminded him the Soveldas was no ordinary storm. This was a storm that stripped away all pretenses, where truth was not just encouraged but enforced.

“Are you ready?” Nera’s voice cut through the growing tension, her tone steady but her eyes betraying a flicker of unease.

Korrin turned to her, his hand tightening around the hilt of his sword. “I don’t know if anyone can truly be ready for this.”

The fog thickened as it drew closer, a shimmering curtain that swallowed the village one building at a time. Korrin could already feel its effects, the truth tugging at his thoughts, demanding to be spoken. He swallowed hard, knowing that once the fog fully enveloped them, there would be no turning back.

“Remember,” Nera whispered, stepping closer. “We need to stick together. The Soveldas doesn’t just strip away lies—it forces thoughts to the surface. Even the ones you’d rather keep hidden.”

As the fog reached them, Korrin felt the pressure in his mind increase, like a vise slowly tightening. The rain intensified, falling in heavy sheets that turned the dirt beneath their feet to mud. He tried to push his thoughts deep down, to hide them where the storm couldn’t reach. But the Soveldas had other plans.

“I’m not ready for this,” Korrin confessed, the words spilling from his lips before he could stop them. His heart raced, but the fog seemed to ease, as if rewarding him for his honesty.

Nera nodded, her expression softening. “None of us are. But we don’t have a choice.”

Suddenly, a wave of thoughts crashed through his mind, not his own but broadcasted by the storm. Fears, desires, and secrets—all laid bare in the downpour. The Soveldas twisted these thoughts, amplifying them until they echoed like thunderclaps in his skull. He could hear Nera’s doubts, her worries about their mission, and beneath it all, a thread of guilt she couldn’t hide.

“We’re going to fail,” Nera’s voice trembled with the truth she could no longer suppress. “I—I don’t think we can stop them.”

Korrin clenched his jaw, fighting to keep his own fears at bay. The fog was almost suffocating now, its density turning the air into something thick and heavy, like breathing through wet cloth. His thoughts were slipping, his defenses crumbling.

“We have to try,” he forced out, though the fog pressed down harder, as if sensing the strain in his words.

Then, like a break in the clouds, the fog around them began to thin. The pressure on his mind lessened, giving him a momentary reprieve. But the Soveldas was far from done. He could still hear the thoughts of those around him, less intense but no less real. The rain slowed to a drizzle, and Korrin realized the storm was testing them, shifting its power as it gauged their resolve.

Korrin met Nera’s gaze, both of them breathless from the struggle. “We can’t lie,” he said, the truth an anchor in the storm. “But we can choose what we believe.”

She nodded, the fog parting just enough for them to see each other clearly. “Then let’s believe we’ll survive this.”

As the Soveldas continued its relentless march, Korrin tightened his grip on his sword and prepared to face whatever truths the storm would drag from the shadows next.

# Vesordas
Thalin felt the first drops of mist on his face, cool and dense as they clung to his skin. The Vesordas had arrived.

The air thickened with moisture, the mist falling in heavy sheets that seemed to muffle the world around him. He glanced back at his companions, their forms already fading into the gray shroud that enveloped them. The Vesordas was notorious for its disorienting effects, and Thalin knew that once the storm truly set in, even the ground beneath their feet would seem to shift and twist.

“Stay close!” Thalin called, his voice swallowed by the thickening mist. He drew his sword, the blade glowing faintly with the protective glyphs etched along its length. The storm was slow at first, deceptively gentle, but he knew better than to trust its initial calm.

Ahead, the first portal blinked into existence—a swirling vortex of mist and orange light. It hovered in the air, crackling with energy, a tear in reality that promised nothing but chaos. Thalin tensed, watching as the portal shifted, its edges warping the space around it. He had heard stories of those who ventured too close, only to be swallowed by the storm, reappearing miles away in an instant.

The storm’s slow beginning was its most dangerous lie. Thalin knew the portals would multiply as the Vesordas gained speed, and with them, the storm’s unpredictable nature would turn deadly.

A flicker of movement caught his eye—a rock, pulled from the ground by some unseen force, floated lazily in the mist. Then, with a sudden jolt, it shot across the clearing, slamming into a tree with a force that splintered the wood. Thalin ducked instinctively as more objects began to lift into the air: stones, branches, even clumps of earth, all caught in the storm’s growing frenzy.

“Thalin!” A voice called out—Dren, his oldest friend, struggling against the pull of another portal that had materialized beside him. The vortex tugged at Dren’s cloak, dragging him closer to its gaping maw.

Thalin sprinted forward, his boots slipping on the wet ground, and reached out just in time to grab Dren’s arm. The portal crackled, a sucking wind pulling at them both, but Thalin planted his feet, digging in as he hauled Dren away from the edge. The two of them tumbled back into the mist, the portal snapping shut with a hiss.

“Thanks,” Dren panted, his face pale in the dim light. “That was too close.”

“We have to keep moving,” Thalin urged, his gaze darting to the swirling mist around them. The storm was speeding up, its once sluggish pace accelerating as the Vesordas shifted into its second phase. The portals were appearing faster now, blinking in and out like the eyes of some great beast watching them from all sides.

The mist thickened further, and Thalin felt the ground beneath him begin to tremble. The storm was reaching its peak, and with it, reality itself seemed to unravel. The floating objects were no longer drifting lazily—they were streaking through the air with deadly speed, crashing into trees and rocks with explosive force. A branch whizzed past Thalin’s head, narrowly missing him as it embedded itself into the ground with a dull thud.

And then, in a heartbeat, the storm’s tempo changed. The mist swirled faster, the portals blinking in and out with dizzying speed, and the floating objects began to whip around them like a tornado of debris. Thalin’s heart pounded as he tried to keep his bearings, but the Vesordas was relentless, its chaotic energy pulling at his senses, disorienting him until he wasn’t sure which way was up.

Another portal opened directly in front of him, and before he could react, he was yanked off his feet, sucked into the vortex. The world spun around him, a blur of mist and light, and then—nothing.

Thalin hit the ground hard, the breath knocked from his lungs as he tumbled across wet earth. He lay there for a moment, dazed, before the storm’s roar brought him back to his senses. Pushing himself up, he realized he was somewhere else, another part of the storm. The Vesordas had spat him out miles from where he had been.

He looked around, hoping to spot Dren or the others, but the mist was too thick, the storm too fast. The Vesordas was in its final phase now, a maelstrom of chaos that would tear apart anything in its path. Thalin knew he had to move, to find his bearings before the storm reached its crescendo.

But even as he staggered to his feet, the storm surged around him, its portals flickering like fireflies in the mist, its winds howling with a wild, untamed fury. And all around him, the Vesordas continued to dance, a storm that obeyed no laws but its own.

# Vizordas
Response 1

Jalen stood at the edge of the field, watching as the first drops of the Vizordas began to fall. The sky above churned with dark, roiling clouds, an ominous warning of what was to come. He could already smell it—the acrid, foul stench that accompanied the storm’s arrival, like rotting leaves mixed with something far worse.

He grimaced, pulling his scarf over his nose and mouth. Around him, the crops were wilting, their vibrant green turning sickly brown as the decay rain soaked into the earth. The plants seemed to wither under the touch of the rain, their leaves curling and blackening as if scorched by invisible flames.

Jalen’s heart sank as he saw the animals huddling in the distance, their movements sluggish, their bodies shuddering with sickness. The Vizordas was not a storm to be taken lightly. It was a force of nature that brought both death and life, a cycle as old as the land itself. But knowing that did little to ease the dread that gnawed at him.

“Get inside!” Jalen called to the others, his voice muffled by the scarf. The villagers were already scrambling for cover, dragging their sick animals with them, but Jalen knew it wouldn’t be enough. Once the decay rain began, the only hope was to wait it out and pray that the storm would bring renewal before it was too late.

The rain fell harder now, each drop carrying the scent of decay. The air grew thick with the stench, clinging to everything it touched. Jalen could feel the sickness in it, a creeping rot that seemed to seep into his very bones. He glanced down at his hands, seeing the rain leave dark stains on his skin, but he forced himself to stay calm. The Vizordas was a test—a trial that would either destroy or renew.

Time passed slowly, the decay rain relentless in its assault. The fields, once lush and full of life, were now a graveyard of twisted, dying plants. The animals that hadn’t made it inside lay motionless, their bodies wracked with sickness. Even the trees, ancient and resilient, were not spared, their bark peeling away in strips, their branches drooping as if in mourning.

Jalen clenched his fists, fighting the urge to scream. He had lived through many storms, but the Vizordas was always the hardest to endure. The death it brought was palpable, a weight that pressed down on his soul.

Then, as suddenly as it had begun, the rain changed.

The foul odor dissipated, replaced by a sweet, almost floral scent that filled the air. The decay rain slowed to a drizzle, then stopped altogether. For a moment, there was silence, broken only by the soft rustle of leaves in the breeze.

And then the life rain began to fall.

Jalen watched in awe as the drops sparkled in the air, catching the light in a way that made them seem almost alive. The rain was warm, soothing, each droplet a balm to the land. Where the decay rain had brought death, the life rain brought renewal.

He could see it happening before his eyes—the plants that had withered and died began to stir, their leaves unfurling, their colors returning in vibrant hues. The fields that had been nothing but a wasteland of decay were now a tapestry of life, the crops growing taller and stronger than they had been before the storm.

The animals that had been sick, those that had survived the first half of the storm, now rose to their feet, their ailments washed away by the life rain. Jalen could hear their cries of relief, could see the light return to their eyes as the storm worked its magic.

He stepped out into the rain, letting it wash over him. The sweet scent filled his lungs, and he felt a warmth spread through his body, healing aches and pains he hadn’t even known he had. The life rain was a gift, a blessing that only the Vizordas could bring.

But he knew its power was fleeting.

Jalen hurried to fill his canteen, letting the life rain pour into it. The water was clear, pure, but he knew it wouldn’t last. Once the storm passed, the water would be just that—water, with no trace of the healing power it carried now. The Vizordas was a force that couldn’t be captured, couldn’t be tamed. Its gift was one that had to be accepted in the moment, or not at all.

The storm began to move on, the rain slowing to a gentle patter. The clouds above lightened, the darkness giving way to the pale light of the sun. Jalen looked around at the renewed land, at the people and animals now free of sickness, and he felt a deep sense of gratitude.

The Vizordas was a harsh teacher, but it was also a generous one. It brought death so that life could flourish, a cycle that had sustained them for generations.

As the last drops of the life rain fell, Jalen turned to the others, a smile breaking through the exhaustion on his face. “We made it,” he said, his voice filled with quiet relief. “The storm has passed.”

And with it, life had returned.

Response 2

Seyla crouched beneath the gnarled tree, her breath shallow as she watched the first droplets of the Vizordas fall from the darkened sky. The storm’s arrival was unmistakable—the air had grown thick and heavy, weighed down by a stench that clawed at her throat. She could already see the effects in the forest around her.

The leaves of the tree above her began to wither, curling in on themselves as if trying to escape the rain. The vibrant green of the forest floor faded, turning a sickly brown as the plants withered under the storm's touch. Seyla’s stomach churned at the sight, the stench growing stronger with each passing second.

A soft whimper drew her attention. Just beyond the tree’s roots, a small fawn lay trembling, its once bright eyes clouded with pain. Seyla reached out instinctively, but drew back as the foul-smelling rain splattered onto her hand, its touch icy cold. The fawn let out a pitiful cry, and Seyla’s heart ached, knowing there was nothing she could do until the storm reached its turning point.

“They’ll be all right,” she whispered to herself, though the words felt hollow. “They’ll be all right.”

The Vizordas had a pattern, a cycle as old as the land itself. It began with decay, an inevitable death that swept through the forest, leaving sickness and rot in its wake. Seyla had witnessed the storm before, had seen its devastating effects, but that knowledge didn’t make the sight any easier to bear.

The rain intensified, the foul odor thickening in the air until it was all Seyla could do to keep from gagging. The ground beneath her seemed to shrivel, roots retreating into the earth as if trying to escape the storm’s poison. Nearby, a bird fell from its perch, its wings crumpled, eyes dull. The storm showed no mercy to the creatures caught in its path.

Seyla shut her eyes, forcing herself to breathe through her mouth, to block out the scent of death. She knew the storm’s cycle would turn soon—it had to. The Vizordas always brought renewal, but only after it had taken its due.

Then, just as the stench reached its peak, the air began to shift. Seyla felt it like a breath of fresh wind cutting through the rot, a whisper of something sweet. She opened her eyes, blinking as the rain softened, its color changing from a sickly gray to a bright, crystalline hue. The stench began to fade, replaced by a fragrance so pure and sweet it made her dizzy.

The life rain had begun.

Around her, the decayed plants began to stir. The brown, withered leaves unfurled, their green returning with a vibrancy that seemed to glow in the dim light. Flowers bloomed where there had been none before, their petals stretching wide to catch the life-giving rain. The fawn, still lying beneath the tree, gave a soft gasp, its eyes clearing, the pain in its body easing as the rain washed over it.

Seyla watched in awe as the fawn rose to its feet, its legs steady, its coat smooth and gleaming. It blinked at her, as if thanking her for the shelter, before bounding off into the renewed forest.

The rain fell steadily now, each drop a balm to the wounded land. Seyla stepped out from under the tree, letting the rain soak into her skin, feeling its warmth, its healing touch. The sweet fragrance filled her senses, driving away the last vestiges of the storm’s decay. She could feel the weariness in her body melting away, the aches and pains vanishing as if they had never been.

She reached out to catch some of the rain in her hand, watching as the clear droplets pooled in her palm. It was said that the life rain couldn’t be contained, that its power only lasted as long as the storm. Seyla had never tested that, never tried to take the rain with her, but now, she was tempted. She wanted to keep a part of this storm’s magic, to hold on to its healing even after it had passed.

But as she watched, the rain in her palm began to fade, losing its glow, its warmth. It became nothing more than water, ordinary and plain. Seyla let it fall back to the ground, a soft smile on her lips.

The Vizordas was a storm of life and death, of endings and beginnings. It couldn’t be captured, couldn’t be tamed. It was a force of nature, as wild and untouchable as the wind.

And in that moment, standing in the heart of the storm, Seyla felt a deep connection to the land, to the cycle that had shaped it for generations. She closed her eyes, letting the rain wash over her, healing not just her body, but her spirit as well.

# Narudas
Nara felt the tension in the air long before the first rumble of the earth. The animals had already fled, the skies above had turned a sickly green, and the wind was picking up with a ferocity that sent shivers down her spine. She knew what was coming—the Narudas, the storm that bent reality itself.

The ground beneath her trembled, the first of many warnings. Nara gripped her staff tighter, scanning the horizon. The once distant peaks were now distorted, their shapes warping as the air thickened with heat. Mirages began to dance across the landscape, shifting forms that flickered in and out of existence. They were beautiful, in a way—an illusionary calm before the storm’s true fury was unleashed.

She had no time to admire them.

The wind roared, slamming into her with the force of a wild beast. Nara braced herself, planting her feet firmly as the gale tried to sweep her off the ground. She could feel the weight of the storm pressing down on her, gravity itself becoming an oppressive force. Every step was a struggle, every movement labored as if the world had grown heavier around her.

A thunderous crack split the air, followed by a deep, resonant boom that shook the earth. Nara looked up just in time to see boulders—massive, ancient stones—wrenched from the mountainside, pulled into the sky by the storm’s impossible gravity. They hung there for a moment, suspended like forgotten toys, before they ignited, flames licking hungrily at their surfaces.

With a deafening roar, the boulders began their descent.

Nara dove behind a ridge, her heart pounding as the flaming rocks crashed down around her, smashing into the ground with explosive force. The impact sent shockwaves rippling through the earth, each one a brutal reminder of the Narudas’ power. She could see trees ripped from their roots, hurled skyward only to be set ablaze and thrown back down, their branches turned to ash before they even hit the ground.

And then the rain came.

It wasn’t a normal rain—not with the Narudas. The drops were heavy, thick with ash and flame, a twisted mixture of water and fire that sizzled as it struck the ground. Nara felt the heat of it even as she huddled beneath her cloak, the rain burning through her defenses like acid. The air was filled with the smell of scorched earth and burning wood, a stench that clung to everything.

She couldn’t stay here—couldn’t wait out the storm in the open like this. Gathering her strength, Nara pushed herself to her feet, her body protesting against the increased gravity. Every step was a battle, her muscles straining against the weight, but she forced herself to move, to find shelter before the storm’s next assault.

The ground rumbled beneath her again, a low, ominous vibration that grew stronger with each passing second. Nara’s breath caught in her throat as the earth itself seemed to rise up, a great wave of stone and dirt rippling toward her. She ran—or tried to, her legs feeling like lead as she fought against the gravity and the shifting ground.

The wave hit, throwing her off balance. She stumbled, falling hard against the ground, but she scrambled to her feet, refusing to give in to the storm. Ahead, she saw a narrow crevice in the rock—a potential refuge from the chaos. She pushed toward it, the roar of the storm in her ears, the fire-laden rain scorching her skin.

Just as she reached the crevice, a new sound joined the cacophony: the unmistakable crack of ice. The Narudas was nearing its end, and with it came the hail—a final, brutal punctuation to the storm’s fury. The hailstones were massive, each one a jagged shard of ice that tore through the air with lethal speed.

Nara threw herself into the crevice just as the first hailstone struck, smashing into the ground where she had stood moments before. She huddled there, pressed against the rock as the storm unleashed its final onslaught. The hail pounded the earth, each impact sending shards of ice and stone flying.

And then, just as quickly as it had begun, the storm started to move on.

The wind began to die down, the rain lessened, and the oppressive gravity started to lift. Nara remained in the crevice, her body aching from the strain, her mind reeling from the storm’s violence. The mirages faded, the illusions dispersing with the retreating storm.

When she finally emerged, the world was unrecognizable. The landscape had been reshaped by the Narudas, twisted into something new and alien. But Nara was alive, and in the aftermath of the storm, that was all that mattered.

She took a deep breath, the air still tinged with the smell of fire and rain, and began the long walk back to what was left of her village. The Narudas had passed, but its memory would linger—etched into the land and into the hearts of those who had survived its wrath.

# Medathas
The first gust of wind tore through the trees, howling like a beast unleashed. The Medathas had arrived. Wren felt the air thicken with an unnatural heat, the scent of decay carried on the wind. He knew what came next—the spores, invisible yet deadly, swirling in the storm’s violent embrace.

He pulled his scarf tighter over his face, his eyes narrowing against the sting of the wind. Around him, the forest began to change. The leaves on the trees curled and blackened as if touched by fire, the vibrant green turning to ash in moments. The ground, once soft and fertile, cracked and crumbled underfoot, as if the very life was being sucked from it.

Wren hurried through the woods, his heart pounding in time with the storm’s growing fury. He could see the spores now, tiny flecks of darkness dancing in the air, carried on the wind like a deadly snow. They latched onto everything—plants, rocks, the surface of the stream that wound through the forest. Wherever they landed, life withered and died.

He stumbled to the stream’s edge, watching in horror as the water darkened, the spores seeping into it, tainting it with their poison. The once-clear stream was now a murky black, the water toxic to any creature that dared drink from it. Even the fish that swam in its depths floated lifelessly to the surface, their scales tarnished and dull.

Above, the sky churned with yellow clouds, an ominous glow that set the world in hues of blood and shadow. And then the lightning began—bolts of crimson that split the sky, striking the earth with a fury that shook the ground. The first strike hit a tree not far from Wren, the impact sending a shockwave through the air. The tree, which had withered and died just moments before, suddenly erupted in new life, its branches bursting with fresh leaves, its trunk straightening as if reborn from the very fire that had struck it.

The yellow lightning spread across the forest, each strike bringing with it a wave of renewal. The plants that had been ravaged by the spores were revitalized, their colors returning with a vibrancy that defied the storm’s violence. The ground, once cracked and barren, softened again, the soil rich with life.

Wren could feel the storm shifting, the heat of it beginning to fade, replaced by a coolness that seeped into his bones. The wind slowed, the howling dying down to a gentle whisper, and with it came the mist—a cool, soothing veil that descended over the forest. The spores, once carried on the wind, were gone, replaced by this gentle fog that wrapped around him like a blanket.

He took a deep breath, the air now tinged with a fresh, almost sweet scent. The mist carried with it a healing touch, soothing the burns and aches left by the storm’s fury. Wren felt the tension in his muscles ease, the pain in his lungs from breathing the tainted air fading away. The world was quiet now, the storm’s violence a distant memory as the Medathas settled into its final form—a peaceful, calming mist that brought relief in its wake.

The visibility was poor, the mist so thick that Wren could barely see a few feet in front of him, but he didn’t mind. The peace that followed the Medathas was a blessing, a moment of tranquility after the chaos. He knew that the forest would recover, the life it had lost during the storm now returning in full force.

As he walked through the mist, Wren felt a sense of gratitude wash over him. The Medathas was a storm of contradictions—a bringer of death and life, of pain and healing. But in the end, it left behind a world renewed, a world where life could begin again.

As the Medathas transitioned from its destructive phase to the healing mist, the fish that had died from the toxic spores remained lifeless in the now-clear stream. Unlike the plants that were revived by the red lightning, the fish did not come back to life. The storm's renewal seemed to focus on the vegetation and the land itself, leaving the animals that perished during the storm untouched. The fish, tainted by the poisoned water, were a tragic reminder of the storm's deadly beginning, even as the land around them began to heal and thrive once more.

# Domendas
The Domendas storm hit without warning, a fury of nature that defied prediction. One moment, the air was thick with an unsettling calm, and the next, the sky erupted in a chaos of lightning and wind. Torrents of rain lashed the ground, and boulders, ripped from the earth, were hurled like toys in the tempest’s grip.

Tarin barely had time to brace himself before the storm was upon him. The wind tore at his clothes, nearly knocking him off his feet as he struggled to stay upright. The sky above was a seething mass of dark clouds, shot through with jagged bolts of lightning that turned night into day in violent, stuttering flashes.

Then came the light shields.

They appeared out of nowhere, shimmering walls of pure energy that burst into existence with a blinding brilliance. Tarin skidded to a halt as one flared to life in front of him, cutting off his path. The shield was impossibly bright, a barrier of light that hummed with raw power, forcing him to take a step back.

He could feel the heat radiating from it, the air around it vibrating with intensity. Behind him, another shield popped into existence, trapping him in a glowing cage. He reached out a hand to touch it, but the heat forced him to withdraw. The shields were impenetrable, and he was caught between them, unable to move forward or back.

But the storm wasn’t done with him yet.

A strange, acrid smell filled the air—a gas that rolled in with the storm, thick and cloying. Tarin breathed it in before he could stop himself, and immediately, something changed. A red haze descended over his vision, his pulse quickening, his mind clouded with a sudden, overwhelming fury.

He snarled, teeth bared, as the rage took hold. The storm, the shields, everything around him—it all became a blur, a haze of anger and violence. Pain faded into the background, insignificant compared to the fire that burned within him. He felt invincible, unstoppable, and the wounds he’d sustained—scrapes, bruises, cuts from the flying debris—were nothing now, mere inconveniences ignored in the face of this raw, unrelenting rage.

Tarin roared, throwing himself against the shield in front of him, uncaring of the heat or the energy that sizzled against his skin. But the shield held firm, unyielding, and he bounced back, staggering but undeterred. He would tear it down, would rip apart anything that stood in his way—if only he could reach it.

But then the storm shifted again.

The wind, already howling, picked up with renewed force, tearing at the ground, ripping up chunks of earth and sending them hurtling through the air. Lightning rained down from the sky in rapid succession, each bolt more intense than the last, striking the ground with explosive force.

The light shields shimmered, reacting to the storm, but they held, protecting whatever lay within their bounds. Tarin was caught in the open, his rage blinding him to the dangers that swirled around him. A boulder, flung by the tempest, slammed into the ground nearby, sending a shockwave that knocked him to his knees.

But even as he struggled to rise, the gas thickened, fueling his anger, dulling his pain. The world narrowed to a single point of focus—survival, destruction, the storm be damned. He pushed himself up, muscles straining, driven by a fury that had no outlet, no target, trapped within the shields and the storm.

And then, as if mocking him, the hail began.

Ice shards the size of his fist rained down, each one a brutal projectile that pounded the earth with a relentless rhythm. Tarin ducked, but the hailstorm was everywhere, the icy missiles slamming into him, driving the breath from his lungs. The gas kept him moving, kept him fighting, but even that rage could not completely shield him from the pain as the hail struck again and again.

Through the storm’s chaos, Tarin could see others—figures moving within the tempest, just as trapped, just as enraged. They, too, were caught between light shields, their forms outlined by the flickering lightning, their movements erratic, driven by the same madness that consumed him. The Domendas had turned them all into beasts, thrashing against the storm, against each other, against the very air.

The storm raged on, an unpredictable, uncontrollable force, and Tarin knew there was no escaping it. There was only survival—brutal, instinctual survival—until the storm finally spent itself and the Domendas released its grip on the world.

But until then, there was nothing but the storm, the fury, and the unyielding light.

# Aeondas
The wind carried an eerie silence as the Aeondas approached. Alon could feel it in the stillness of the air, a quiet that pressed against his ears, promising a storm unlike any other. The sky above was a strange mix of colors—muted grays and blues that swirled together, almost peaceful if not for the underlying tension that made his skin prickle.

He’d been warned about the Aeondas, about the gas that seeped into the air, bringing nightmares so vivid they felt real. But knowing didn’t make it any easier when the first tendrils of the gas reached him, curling around his legs like a creeping fog. Alon breathed in, and immediately, the world around him shifted.

The gas brought with it visions—terrible, horrifying visions.

Alon’s eyes widened as the landscape around him warped, the familiar hills and trees twisting into grotesque shapes. Shadows moved at the edges of his vision, dark forms that flickered and danced, impossible to focus on. He felt a coldness in his chest, a sharp, icy dread that clawed at his heart, and then the first nightmare hit.

He saw himself standing in a field of bones, the ground littered with the remains of countless dead. Their hollow eyes stared up at him, accusing, and as he tried to move, he found he couldn’t. His feet were rooted to the spot, held fast by the skeletal hands that reached out from the ground, clutching at his legs. He screamed, but no sound came, his voice lost in the endless void around him.

And then, just as suddenly as it had come, the vision faded, replaced by another. This time, he was running—fleeing through a dark forest, branches tearing at his skin, shadows chasing him with whispers of death. The fear was suffocating, overwhelming, each step heavier than the last as if something unseen was dragging him down. He could feel the cold breath of the pursuer on his neck, could almost hear the words it whispered—promises of pain, of an end that he couldn’t escape.

But then, through the gas-induced horrors, the rain began to fall.

At first, Alon barely noticed it, his mind trapped in the nightmare, but as the raindrops touched his skin, a warmth spread through him. The visions of death faded, the shadows retreating as the sweet memories the rain carried washed over him. The world brightened, the darkness lifting as he found himself standing in a sunlit meadow, the air filled with the scent of wildflowers.

He saw his mother, her smile warm and kind, as she called out to him from a distance. The sound of her voice, so real, so comforting, brought tears to his eyes. Alon remembered this—this moment from his childhood, a day spent running through fields, laughing without a care in the world. The rain wrapped him in that memory, soothing the terror that had gripped him moments before.

The storm, however, wasn’t done playing with time.

As Alon moved through the rain-soaked landscape, he stumbled into a bubble—one of the strange pockets of space where time itself bent and twisted. The air within the bubble shimmered, distorting his view of the world beyond. He felt a sudden pull, like stepping into a current, and the world around him slowed to a crawl.

Each raindrop hung in the air, suspended like tiny jewels, catching the light in a way that was almost mesmerizing. Alon reached out, his movements languid, and touched one of the drops. It moved at his touch, rippling outwards in slow motion, the surface tension holding it together longer than it should. Time was distorted here, stretched out, each second lasting an eternity.

But as he took a step forward, he slipped into another bubble, and the world around him sped up. The raindrops became a blur, the wind whipping past him with sudden ferocity. His heart raced, each beat a thunderous echo in his ears as time rushed forward, pushing him ahead at a breakneck pace. The memories brought by the rain flickered through his mind—brief, fragmented flashes of joy and peace, almost too fast to grasp.

And then, just as suddenly, he was out of the bubble, time snapping back to normal, leaving him disoriented and breathless.

The Aeondas continued to swirl around him, a storm of contradictions—nightmares and sweet dreams, the slow and the fast, all interwoven in a tapestry of chaos. Alon took a deep breath, grounding himself in the reality of the moment, even as the storm tested the limits of his sanity.

He knew he had to keep moving, to survive the storm’s whims and reach safety before the next wave of gas or time-shifted rain found him. But even as he pressed forward, the memory of the nightmare lingered, a shadow at the edge of his thoughts, reminding him of the darkness the Aeondas had brought with it.

The storm was merciless, a reminder that even in the sweetest dreams, there were nightmares waiting to pounce.

# Unique Storms

## Veridas
The Veridas arrived quietly, a gentle breeze stirring the leaves in the trees. Unlike other storms that roared in with thunder and fury, the Veridas crept in softly, almost unnoticed. The sky, instead of darkening, brightened, its hues shifting to a warm, golden glow that spread across the horizon.

Darin stood at the edge of the village, watching as the light deepened, bathing everything in a soft, ethereal radiance. He had heard stories of the Veridas, a holy storm that brought with it a sense of peace and joy, but he had never witnessed it himself. Now, as the first hints of the storm touched the land, he felt a warmth spreading through his chest, a gentle pressure that lifted his spirits.

The wind carried with it a subtle melody, a harmonious tune that seemed to resonate with his very soul. As it drifted through the village, the people around him paused in their tasks, their expressions softening as the music filled the air. It was as if the storm spoke to them, not in words, but in emotions, each note wrapping around their hearts and easing their worries.

The first drops of rain fell, not with the sharp sting of cold water, but with a warmth that soaked into the skin, bringing with it a sense of comfort and belonging. Darin closed his eyes, letting the rain wash over him, and felt a deep-seated joy welling up from within. Memories of his childhood, of laughter and love, floated to the surface of his mind, and he smiled, the worries of the present moment fading away.

The villagers began to gather in the square, drawn by the storm’s embrace. Old grievances were forgotten, replaced by laughter and embraces as the Veridas worked its magic. Darin watched as friends who had not spoken in years came together, their hands clasped in renewed camaraderie, their faces lit with smiles that reached their eyes.

He could see it in everyone—the peace, the happiness that the Veridas brought. Children danced in the rain, their laughter ringing through the air, and even the elderly, who usually moved with the burden of years, found a new lightness in their steps. The entire village seemed to glow, each person wrapped in a cocoon of contentment that the storm had woven around them.

Darin walked through the village, his heart swelling with a love for the people around him, a love that the Veridas seemed to have awakened. He passed by the old well in the center of the square, where a group had gathered, singing songs of hope and joy. The melody of their voices blended with the music of the storm, creating a harmony so beautiful that it brought tears to his eyes.

The Veridas was not a storm of destruction, nor of fear, but a storm of renewal. It swept through the village like a blessing, washing away the burdens of the past and leaving in its wake a sense of unity and joy. Darin felt lighter than he had in years, as if the storm had lifted the weight from his shoulders, leaving him free to embrace the simple pleasures of life.

As the rain continued to fall, Darin found himself standing beside his father, who had come out of their home to witness the storm. They exchanged a glance, and in that moment, all the unspoken words between them seemed to dissolve. There was no need for apologies or explanations; the Veridas had done its work, bridging the gap between them with a simple, shared smile.

The storm lasted through the night, its gentle rain falling in a steady rhythm that lulled the village into a peaceful slumber. When morning came, the Veridas had moved on, leaving behind a world that seemed brighter, more alive. The villagers awoke to a new day, their hearts light, their spirits lifted by the storm’s gift.

Darin stood at the edge of the village once more, watching the sunrise. The Veridas was gone, but its presence lingered in the hearts of those it had touched. The peace, the happiness, the joy—it was as if the storm had planted seeds of light within them, seeds that would grow and flourish long after the storm itself had passed.

## Corudas

The Corudas storm descended upon the land like a nightmare made real.

It announced itself with a low, ominous hum, a sound that seemed to vibrate through the very bones of the earth. The sky, once a serene blue, turned a sickly green, bruised with black clouds that churned and twisted like something alive. The air grew thick, oppressive, as if the atmosphere itself had become tainted by the storm’s malevolence.

Eron stood at the edge of the village, his heart pounding in his chest as he watched the darkness approach. He had heard of the Corudas, the unholy storm that twisted everything it touched, but he had never imagined it would come here. The villagers had begun to flee, their faces pale with terror, but Eron was rooted to the spot, unable to tear his eyes away from the swirling abyss in the sky.

The first gust of wind hit with a force that nearly knocked him off his feet. It carried with it a scent of decay, a foul stench that made his stomach churn. Eron gagged, covering his mouth with his sleeve, but the smell persisted, as if the storm had brought with it the rot of a thousand graves.

Then came the rain.

It fell in thick, black droplets that sizzled as they hit the ground, leaving scorch marks wherever they landed. The earth itself seemed to recoil from the touch of the rain, the grass withering and the trees twisting as if in agony. Eron could feel the coldness in the rain, a chill that seeped into his bones, numbing his limbs and clouding his mind with dread.

But it was the malefic that truly brought terror.

They emerged from the storm, wraith-like beings formed of shadow and corruption. Their eyes glowed with a malevolent light, and their bodies seemed to shift and change, never holding a single form for long. The malefic drifted through the village, their presence warping reality around them, twisting the shapes of the houses, the streets, even the very air.

Eron watched in horror as one of the malefic approached a fleeing villager, its dark tendrils reaching out like fingers. The moment it touched the man, he screamed—a sound that cut through the howling wind, filled with such agony that it made Eron’s blood run cold. The man’s body twisted, contorting in unnatural ways, his face a mask of pure terror as the malefic fed on his fear.

But it was not just fear they fed on; the malefic seemed to draw strength from the storm itself, growing more solid, more real, with each passing moment. They reveled in the chaos, their whispers filling the air with dark promises and venomous lies. Eron could hear them, those voices, clawing at the edges of his mind, trying to worm their way inside.

“Give in,” they hissed. “Let us take your pain away. There is no hope, no escape. Only the storm, only the darkness.”

Eron shook his head, trying to banish the voices, but they were relentless, their words dripping with a poison that made his thoughts sluggish, his will weak. He could feel the despair settling over him, a heavy weight that made it hard to breathe. It would be so easy to give in, to let the darkness take him, to become one with the storm and the malefic.

But deep inside, something resisted. A spark of light, a memory of warmth and hope. The Veridas had passed through this village once, not long ago, leaving behind a trace of its holy peace. Eron clung to that memory, using it as a shield against the encroaching darkness.

The malefic sensed his resistance, and they turned their attention to him, their whispers growing louder, more insistent. Eron could feel their cold gaze on him, their hunger for his surrender. But instead of fleeing, he took a step forward, his hands clenched into fists at his sides.

“You won’t take me,” he growled, his voice trembling but determined. “You won’t take any of us.”

The malefic hissed in anger, their shadows swirling around him, but Eron stood firm, his mind focused on the light, on the peace the Veridas had once brought. He didn’t know how long he could hold out, but he knew he had to try. The Corudas was a storm of darkness, of corruption, but he would not let it claim him. Not today.

As the storm raged on, the battle between light and darkness played out within Eron’s soul. The Corudas was relentless, but so was he, a lone figure standing against the tide of malevolence, holding onto the hope that the light would return and banish the darkness once more.
