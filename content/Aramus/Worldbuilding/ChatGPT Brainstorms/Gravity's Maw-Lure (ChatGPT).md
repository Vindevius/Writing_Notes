Every 21 hours Esderrus passes by overhead, bringing a gravity storm. Every 4 passes or 3 days, a stronger gravity storm occurs. A gravity storm consists of earthquakes, volcanic activity, higher tides, etc... Gravity is at 50% during a gravity storm. During a gravity storm, the gravity is halved on Donovus. After the more powerful gravity storms, gravity compacts boulders and rocks into gravity stones. These crystallized stones vary in size from small pebbles and large stones. The gravity stones are dark in color, almost like obsidian, with glowing veins of crystal. The glowing veins of crystal vary in color. Light distorts around the stone. The stones are perfectly spherical, outside of the glowing crystals. The most common light color is white. The following is a list of colors the lights appear in from common to rare: white, green, blue, yellow, indigo, orange, red, and violet. Black also a appears very rarely. A gravity stone has a density of 22.59 g/cm3. A 4 inch circumference stone is 1 lb. A 9 inch circumference stone is 10 lbs. The average gravity stone is 2.5 inch circumference with a weight of 0.22 lbs or 97.68 grams.

**Gravity’s Maw**

Raen braced herself as the ground trembled beneath her feet. The familiar rumble of the earth announced Esderrus's approach. In the sky, the distant gas giant loomed like a celestial predator, its presence pulling at Donovus’s very bones.

Every twenty-one hours, the planet passed close enough to spawn chaos. But this time was different—she could feel it in the air, a tension that whispered of something more. A stronger gravity storm was coming.

She stood on the edge of the cliff, looking down at the blackened sea far below. The water churned and boiled, waves crashing against the jagged rocks with a fury that matched her racing heart. Already, the gravity was lighter, a faint sensation of weightlessness creeping into her limbs. The familiar half-gravity always unsettled her, making her steps feel too long, her leaps too high. But it was the calm before the real storm.

Raen’s eyes darted to the horizon, where the first signs of the coming tempest appeared. The land itself seemed to bow under the pressure, the rocks groaning as if protesting their very existence. Distant mountains began to crack, their jagged peaks glowing with the first eruptions of molten rock. Volcanic ash spewed into the sky, blotting out the sun, casting the land in a foreboding twilight.

"Hold fast!" the voice of her mentor, Kazran, echoed from behind her. The older man stood steady, his eyes fixed on the horizon. He was a veteran of these storms, his body and mind hardened by years of survival on Donovus. “This is the fourth pass. It will be worse than before.”

Raen nodded, though her mouth was dry with fear. She had only been through one of these stronger storms, and even then, she had barely survived. The memory of the earth splitting beneath her feet, the world itself tearing apart, was still fresh in her mind.

As Esderrus drew closer, the world seemed to hold its breath. Gravity weakened further, and Raen felt herself growing lighter, her boots barely keeping contact with the ground. But this lightness was not a gift—it was a harbinger of destruction.

The storm hit with a force that took her breath away. The ground heaved, throwing her off balance. She barely caught herself, gripping a nearby boulder as the earth beneath her feet rolled like the sea in a storm. Trees were uprooted, flung into the air like toys, their roots exposed to the boiling sky.

And then the stones began to fall.

Raen watched, awe-struck, as boulders larger than houses were lifted by the erratic gravity, only to be slammed back into the earth with a force that shook the very heavens. Where they struck, the ground cracked and splintered, but something new formed as well. From the shattered remains of rock and earth, strange, dark stones began to emerge—gravity stones.

They were beautiful, in a terrifying way. Spheres of blackness, as if they had been cut from the void itself, with veins of light that pulsed with life. The common white glowed faintly, like distant stars, while rarer colors—greens, blues, and even a glimmering yellow—flickered like dying embers. The air around them shimmered, light bending and distorting, creating an eerie halo that made Raen’s skin crawl.

She reached out hesitantly, her fingers brushing the surface of a smaller stone that had rolled to her feet. It was warm to the touch, heavier than it looked, with a strange pull that made her feel both grounded and adrift. The veins of light within it pulsed rhythmically, like a heartbeat, and for a moment, she felt a connection—something ancient and powerful, as if the stone held the secrets of the universe within its core.

Kazran’s hand on her shoulder broke the spell. “Not now,” he said, his voice tight with urgency. “We need to move. The worst is yet to come.”

She looked up at him, saw the worry etched in his weathered face, and nodded. Together, they turned away from the stones and began the treacherous journey back to the shelter, the ground quaking beneath them. The storm raged on, but the gravity stones remained, scattered across the landscape, a reminder of the world’s wrath and its strange, otherworldly beauty.

As they descended into the safety of the underground bunker, Raen couldn’t help but glance back at the stones one last time. They pulsed in the darkness, calling to her with a silent, irresistible voice. She knew she would return for them.

After all, how could she resist the pull of gravity?

The wind was brisk as it rippled across the surface of Midium Lake. The dock and two large ships on either side of Averian swayed gently back and forth like a mother cradling her baby. His short, light brown hair ruffled slightly in the wind. Averian stared down at his distorted reflection in the water. His sad blue-green eyes were imperceptible in the shimmering reflection of those sapphire depths. The water had been calm a moment earlier. To the west, a large green and blue moon arched over the horizon. The continent closest to Donovus had seven concentric rings dug into it. The Verithian rings. The home of Verithinus, Averian’s god. Esderrus was large in the sky. Averian held one hand out toward it. While the sun was the size of Averian’s thumbnail, Esderrus was a ball that fit in his hand. The docks shuddered. A gravity storm was about to start. Averian should head home. He should get away from the dock he sat on. Yet he remained sitting, clutching to the silvery blue locket in his hand. His legs dangled off the side of the dock as the tide began to rise. The water was still well below the water line on the dock. The line that only the worst gravity storms would pass. Averian’s eyes shifted to the nearby shoreline, where water began flowing into the irrigation ditches and canals. Luckily, this wasn’t a major gravity storm. Averian could stay out in it. The gravity storm during the coming night, in the storm cast hours of the morning, that was a death sentence. The full force of the gravity storm wouldn’t occur for another 13 minutes. The gravity storms were regular. They lasted 80 minutes, 54 minutes at full force. The two large ships on either side were attached to the docks by heavy-duty mooring lines. In this sheltered bay, a stormwall rose to the west to protect the docks from any stray boulders the storm threw up. The ships would be weighed down by gravity stones. The perfect anchor for this storm tossed land. Averian glanced back into the water below. It was like glancing off a cliff. Crystals gleamed green, white, and blue at the end of chains below, surrounded by black, obsidian-like rock. Those would be the gravity stones used as anchors. The docks had to be built well above the water. Reinforced staircases made of oak and gravity stones veined with various crystal light normally led down to the boats moored below. They had been stored beneath the dock by the dockhands. The dock shook briefly. The gravity storm would be in full force soon. Averian could not tell how long he sat at the edge of this dock. Perhaps hours? Averian’s mind was far away from this dock. His eyes pierced the lake’s surface as though by doing so he could see into the memories of the past through the gravity light below.

**Gravity’s Lure**

The wind whispered across Midium Lake, tugging at Averian’s short, light brown hair and rippling the water's surface. The dock beneath him creaked, the two large ships moored on either side swaying in rhythm with the gentle motion, like a mother cradling her child. Averian’s gaze remained fixed on the water, where his distorted reflection shimmered. The sad blue-green eyes that stared back were lost in the sapphire depths, nearly swallowed by the lake’s constant movement.

A moment ago, the lake had been calm. But now, to the west, Esderrus crested the horizon, its vast green and blue form dominating the sky. The moon's continents were visible even from here, the most striking of which bore seven concentric rings etched deep into its surface—the Verithian rings, the sacred home of Verithinus, Averian’s god.

Esderrus loomed large, and Averian lifted a hand toward it, as if he could grasp the moon. Where the sun was no larger than his thumbnail, Esderrus filled his palm, a massive orb of life and mystery. The dock beneath him shuddered, a warning of what was to come.

A gravity storm was about to begin.

Averian knew he should head home, leave the dock before the storm reached its full force. But he stayed where he was, his legs dangling over the edge, fingers clutching the silvery blue locket that had never left his side. The tide was rising now, slowly creeping up the shoreline. He noted the water beginning to fill the irrigation ditches and canals nearby, the first signs of the storm's approach.

This storm wasn’t a major one, just a precursor to the more dangerous one due to hit in the storm-cast hours of the coming night. That one would be deadly, a force of nature no one could withstand. But for now, Averian could remain where he was, letting the world’s chaotic rhythms wash over him.

He had thirteen minutes before the full force of the gravity storm hit. The storms were predictable, following a relentless pattern: eighty minutes in total, with fifty-four of those at full strength. He glanced at the ships beside him, their massive forms secured to the dock by heavy-duty mooring lines. The sheltered bay was protected by a stormwall to the west, designed to shield the docks from the boulders hurled skyward by the storm. The ships themselves were anchored by gravity stones—perfect spheres of obsidian-like rock veined with crystals—that were the only true anchor in this storm-battered land.

Averian’s gaze drifted back to the water. Beneath the surface, chains ending in gravity stones gleamed, their green, white, and blue lights refracting through the lake’s depths. These stones, embedded in the docks and staircases, were more than just anchors—they were relics of the storm’s aftermath, forged in the chaos of Donovus’s fury. The reinforced oak staircases that led down to the boats were lined with these stones, though now they were stored away, hidden from the storm’s reach.

The dock shook again, more violently this time. The gravity storm was nearly upon him. Averian couldn’t tell how long he had been sitting there, lost in thought. His mind had wandered far from the dock, far from the rising storm. He stared into the lake as if by sheer will he could peer into the past, into the memories locked away in the shimmering light of the gravity stones below.

But no matter how hard he looked, the past remained just as distant as Esderrus, beyond his reach yet forever pulling at his heart, a force of gravity all its own.

**Gravity’s Maw**

Raen braced herself as the ground trembled beneath her feet, the familiar rumble that heralded the approach of Esderrus. In the sky, the green and blue moon loomed like a vast, living god, its presence pulling at Donovus’s very bones. The gravity storm was coming, and this one would be stronger than most.

Every twenty-one hours, the world braced for the chaos that followed Esderrus's passing. But this time was different—Raen could feel it in the air, a tension that buzzed against her skin. The storm would be fierce, more powerful than anything she'd faced before.

She stood on the edge of the cliff, overlooking the blackened sea below. The water churned violently, waves crashing against the jagged rocks with a force that matched her racing heart. Already, gravity was weakening, a strange lightness creeping into her limbs. Each step felt too long, each breath too easy. The sensation was unsettling, but it was the calm before the true storm.

Raen’s eyes were drawn to the horizon, where the first signs of the tempest appeared. The land itself seemed to buckle under the strain, rocks groaning as the earth began to heave. Distant mountains cracked open, their peaks glowing with the first eruptions of molten rock. Volcanic ash spewed into the sky, blotting out the sun and casting the world into an eerie twilight.

“Hold fast!” Kazran’s voice rang out behind her. The older man stood steady, his eyes fixed on the distant chaos. He had survived more storms than Raen could count, his body and mind hardened by the trials of Donovus. “This is the fourth pass. It’ll be worse than before.”

Raen nodded, though fear coiled tight in her chest. She had lived through one of these stronger storms before, and the memory of the earth splitting beneath her feet still haunted her. But this time, she wasn’t just a victim of the storm. This time, she was ready.

As Esderrus drew closer, the world seemed to hold its breath. Gravity weakened further, and Raen felt herself growing lighter, her boots barely keeping contact with the ground. But this lightness was no gift—it was a harbinger of destruction.

The storm hit with a force that stole her breath away. The ground heaved violently, nearly throwing her off balance. She caught herself, gripping a nearby boulder as the earth rolled beneath her like the sea in a storm. Trees were ripped from the ground, flung into the air like toys by the shifting gravity. And then the stones began to fall.

Raen watched in awe as massive boulders were lifted by the erratic gravity, only to be slammed back into the earth with a force that shook the heavens. Where they struck, the ground shattered, but something new emerged from the destruction—gravity stones.

The stones were beautiful, in a terrifying way. Spheres of obsidian-like rock, veined with pulsing lines of light. White, green, and blue crystals flickered within the stones, their glow bending the light around them in strange, distorted patterns. The air shimmered with their energy, and Raen felt the familiar pull, the connection she had always known but never fully understood.

She reached out, her hand trembling as it hovered over a smaller stone that had rolled to her feet. As her fingers brushed its warm surface, the light within the stone pulsed brighter, as if responding to her touch. She closed her eyes, focusing on the light, drawing it into herself. The energy flowed into her, filling her with a power that was both exhilarating and terrifying.

Kazran’s hand on her shoulder broke her concentration. “Not now,” he said, his voice tight with urgency. “We need to move. The worst is yet to come.”

She looked up at him, saw the concern in his weathered face, and nodded. Together, they turned away from the stones and began the treacherous journey back to the shelter. The storm raged on, but the gravity stone in Raen’s hand continued to pulse, a reminder of the power she now held.

As they descended into the safety of the underground bunker, Raen glanced back at the stones one last time. They glowed in the darkness, calling to her with a silent, irresistible voice. She knew she would return for them. After all, how could she resist the pull of gravity—both the storm’s and her own newfound power?

**Gravity’s Maw**

Raen braced herself as the ground quivered beneath her, the familiar tremors heralding the approach of Esderrus. Above her, the vast green and blue moon loomed, pulling at Donovus with an ancient, unyielding force. This gravity storm would be stronger than any before it—she could feel it in her bones.

Every twenty-one hours, the world held its breath as Esderrus passed overhead, but this time, something was different. The air was thick with tension, an electric charge that danced along her skin, making every hair stand on end. The storm would be fierce, and Raen knew she needed to be ready.

She stood on the cliff's edge, overlooking the churning black sea. Waves crashed against jagged rocks far below, their fury mirroring the storm in her heart. Gravity was already weakening, a strange lightness creeping into her limbs. Each step felt too long, each breath too easy. It was the unsettling calm before the storm's full fury.

Raen’s eyes were drawn to the horizon, where the first signs of the tempest began to manifest. The land seemed to bow under the strain, rocks groaning as the earth heaved. Distant mountains cracked open, their peaks glowing with molten rock. Volcanic ash billowed into the sky, turning day into an ominous twilight.

“Hold fast!” Kazran’s voice cut through the rising winds. The older man stood firm, his gaze locked on the horizon. He had weathered more storms than Raen could count, his body a testament to the relentless trials of Donovus. “This is the fourth pass. It’ll be worse than before.”

Raen nodded, though fear gripped her tightly. She had survived one of these stronger storms in the past, but this time, she wasn’t just a survivor—she was something more.

As Esderrus drew closer, the world seemed to teeter on the edge of oblivion. Gravity weakened further, and Raen felt herself growing lighter, her feet barely clinging to the earth. But this lightness was no relief; it was a prelude to the coming destruction.

The storm struck with a force that nearly sent her sprawling. The ground bucked beneath her, and she caught herself against a boulder, holding on as the earth rolled like the sea. Trees were uprooted, flung into the air by the shifting gravity, and then the stones began to fall.

Raen’s breath caught as massive boulders were lifted and hurled back to the ground with terrifying force. Where they struck, the earth shattered, and from the ruins emerged something extraordinary—gravity stones.

The stones were mesmerizing, dark as night with veins of pulsing light. White, green, blue—each stone flickered with its own strange energy, bending the light around it in ways that defied reason. Raen felt a pull toward them, a connection she had always known but never understood.

She reached out toward a smaller stone at her feet, her fingers brushing its warm surface. The light within it flared brightly in response, and she felt a surge of power, a flow of energy that called to her very soul. But before she could draw the light into herself, the stone trembled violently.

With a sharp crack, the stone shattered in her hand, sending shards of obsidian-like rock flying. A brilliant white light burst forth, followed by a cascade of green and blue. The air around her seemed to split, and from the heart of the storm, something emerged.

The light coalesced into a figure—no, not a figure, but something more primal, more elemental. It was a spirit, a being of pure energy, its form shifting and twisting like smoke in the wind. It hovered before her, its eyes—if they could be called that—gleaming with an ancient intelligence. Other spirits, each a different color, swirled around it, drawn from the shattered stones at her feet.

Raen’s breath caught in her throat as the spirits circled her, their energies pulsing in time with the storm. She should have been afraid, but instead, she felt something else—an understanding, a recognition.

The white spirit, the first to emerge, moved closer. It reached out, touching her chest, and Raen gasped as its energy flowed into her. The connection was immediate, like a key turning in a lock. The other spirits followed, their energies merging with hers, filling her with a power unlike anything she had ever known.

Kazran’s voice snapped her back to reality. “Raen!” He reached for her, eyes wide with fear as he saw the spirits binding themselves to her. “We need to move. Now!”

She turned to him, her eyes glowing with the light of the spirits within her. “I’m not the same, Kazran,” she whispered, though her voice was strong. “I can feel it—this power, it’s mine.”

But there was no time to dwell on it. The storm raged on, the ground shaking beneath them. Together, they made their way back to the shelter, Raen’s steps sure and steady despite the chaos around her. The spirits remained within her, their power thrumming in her veins.

As they descended into the safety of the underground bunker, Raen glanced back at the shattered stones. The spirits’ light still flickered among the fragments, but they were hers now, bound to her by the storm. She knew she would return, not just to survive the storms, but to harness their power.

After all, how could she resist the pull of gravity—both the storm’s and her own newfound strength?

**Gravity’s Maw**

Raen steadied herself as the ground beneath her quaked, the tremors growing stronger with each passing moment. Above, Esderrus loomed, its green and blue surface dominating the sky, pulling at Donovus like a relentless, unseen hand. She knew this gravity storm would be more powerful than any before it—a force of nature that promised both destruction and, perhaps, something more.

Every twenty-one hours, the world prepared for the chaos that Esderrus’s passage would bring. But this time, the air crackled with a different energy, one that buzzed against Raen’s skin and made her heart race. The storm wasn’t just coming—it was on the brink of breaking loose.

Standing on the cliff’s edge, Raen looked out over the roiling black sea. Waves crashed furiously against the jagged rocks below, as if the ocean itself was trying to claw its way free of the storm’s grasp. Gravity had already begun to weaken, a sensation of lightness creeping through her body. Every step felt unnaturally long, every breath too easy. This lightness was the prelude to the true storm, the calm before the world was torn asunder.

Raen’s gaze turned to the horizon, where the first signs of the tempest were visible. The land seemed to groan under the strain, distant mountains cracking open, spewing molten rock and ash into the sky. The earth itself was coming apart, and yet Raen felt something stir within her—a pull, an instinct she couldn’t quite place.

“Hold fast!” Kazran’s voice cut through the rising wind. The older man stood resolute, his eyes locked on the chaos unfolding before them. He had survived countless storms, his body and spirit forged by the relentless trials of Donovus. “This is the fourth pass. It’ll be worse than before.”

Raen nodded, though fear tightened in her chest. She had faced a storm like this once, but this time felt different. This time, she was ready for whatever the storm would bring.

As Esderrus neared, the world seemed to teeter on the edge of disaster. Gravity weakened further, and Raen felt her connection to the ground slipping away. But this was no moment of relief—this was the herald of destruction.

The storm struck with a ferocity that nearly knocked her off her feet. The earth heaved beneath her, and she clung to a nearby boulder as the ground rolled and buckled. Trees were wrenched from the soil, tossed into the air by the chaotic gravity, and then the stones began to fall.

Massive boulders, pulled from the mountains by the storm’s fury, hurtled through the sky. Raen watched in awe as these colossal rocks collided in midair, smashing into each other with a deafening crack. The force of the impact shattered them into countless fragments, and from this destruction, something extraordinary was born—gravity stones.

The stones were dark and smooth, almost like polished obsidian, but each was veined with pulsing lines of light. The air shimmered as the stones collided again, more violently this time. One of them, a large stone with veins of white light, struck another with a flash of energy. The impact shattered them both, sending shards flying in all directions. More stones followed, smashing into each other, their lights blending and twisting in the air.

Raen’s breath caught as the shattered stones fell around her, their energy bleeding into the atmosphere. From the ruins of the stones, something began to take shape—a being of pure light and energy, born from the collision.

The first to emerge was the white elemental, its form shifting and ethereal, like a ghost made of light. It hovered before Raen, its eyes—if they could be called that—gleaming with an ancient, unknowable intelligence. As it drifted closer, three other elementals formed around it: one green, vibrant and pulsing like the heart of a forest; one blue, deep and fluid, like a fragment of the ocean itself; and one red, fierce and flickering like a living flame.

Raen stared, entranced, as the elementals circled her. She felt their energy tugging at her, pulling her toward them. The white elemental moved closer, reaching out with a tendril of light that brushed against her chest. She gasped as a surge of power flooded into her, a connection forming between them that felt both exhilarating and terrifying.

The green, blue, and red elementals followed, each touching her in turn, their energies merging with hers, filling her with a power that was as vast as the storm itself. The world around her faded, leaving only the elementals and the raw energy they had gifted her.

Kazran’s shout broke through the haze. “Raen! We need to move!”

His voice was urgent, filled with fear as he watched the spirits binding themselves to her. But Raen was no longer afraid. She could feel the power within her, the energy of the elementals coursing through her veins.

“I’m not the same, Kazran,” she said, her voice steady despite the chaos. “This power—it’s mine now.”

But there was no time to linger. The storm was still raging, the ground shaking beneath them. Together, they made their way back to the shelter, Raen moving with newfound confidence. The elementals remained with her, their light glowing faintly beneath her skin, a reminder of the power she now wielded.

As they descended into the safety of the underground bunker, Raen glanced back at the shattered stones. The elementals’ light still flickered among the fragments, but they were hers now, bound to her by the storm’s fury. She knew she would return—not just to survive the storms, but to master the power they had given her.

After all, how could she resist the pull of gravity—both the storm’s and her own newfound strength?

**Gravity’s Maw**

Raen stood at the edge of the cliff, the ground beneath her feet trembling as the sky darkened. Esderrus loomed overhead, its green and blue surface a vast presence that seemed to pull at the very essence of Donovus. The gravity storm was coming, more powerful than any she had faced before, and Raen could feel it in her bones.

Every twenty-one hours, Esderrus passed overhead, bringing with it chaos and destruction. But this time, the air crackled with a different energy—something deeper, more primal. The storm wasn’t just coming; it was about to unleash something extraordinary.

Raen’s eyes were drawn to the horizon, where the first signs of the tempest were visible. The earth groaned under the strain, distant mountains splitting open to release molten rock and ash into the sky. The sea below her churned, waves crashing violently against the jagged rocks far below. Gravity had already begun to weaken, a strange lightness creeping through her limbs. Each step felt unnaturally long, each breath too easy. This was the calm before the storm’s true fury.

As the winds howled and the ground trembled, Raen’s attention was captured by the falling boulders. Massive stones, pulled from the mountains by the storm’s fury, were hurtling through the sky. These weren’t just any rocks; they were gravity stones, their dark surfaces gleaming like obsidian, veined with light that pulsed in time with the storm.

The stones hung in the air for a brief, surreal moment, their strange beauty mesmerizing. Each stone was perfectly spherical, except for the veins of glowing crystal that ran through them, bending the light in strange and wondrous ways. The veins shimmered in different colors—white, green, blue, and red—each glowing with an inner light that seemed almost alive.

Then, with a sound like the crack of thunder, the stones collided. The impact sent shockwaves through the air, and Raen watched in awe as the stones shattered, fragments flying in all directions. But instead of falling to the ground, the shards of the stones seemed to hang suspended, held aloft by an unseen force.

From the heart of the shattered stones, something began to emerge. Light poured from the fragments, coalescing into forms that were not quite physical, yet undeniably present.

The first to take shape was the white elemental, its body composed of swirling light, its form shifting and ethereal. It hovered in the air before Raen, its eyes—if they could be called that—gleaming with an ancient, unknowable intelligence.

As the white elemental took form, three others emerged from the shards around it. The first was green, vibrant and pulsing like the heart of a living forest. The second was blue, deep and fluid, like the essence of the ocean itself. The third was red, fierce and flickering, like a living flame.

The elementals seemed to pulse with life, their energies swirling and mixing in the air. Then, with a sudden, fluid motion, the green, blue, and red elementals began to drift toward the white one. Their lights intertwined, merging together into a brilliant, blinding glow.

Raen felt a surge of power as the colored elementals merged completely with the white one, their combined energy intensifying, growing stronger. The white elemental, now infused with the power of all three, turned its gaze to Raen.

It moved toward her, its light pulsing with an irresistible energy. Raen could feel the connection between them, a bond forming that went beyond the physical. As the elemental reached out, its light touched her chest, and she gasped as the energy flowed into her. The power filled her, overwhelming yet exhilarating, as if she had become one with the storm itself.

Kazran’s voice broke through the rush of power. “Raen! We need to move!”

His voice was tight with urgency, but Raen was no longer afraid. She could feel the power of the elemental within her, its energy thrumming in her veins, a part of her now.

“I’m not the same, Kazran,” she said, her voice steady despite the chaos. “This power—it’s mine now.”

There was no time to dwell on it. The storm raged on, the ground shaking beneath them as they made their way back to the shelter. Raen moved with a newfound confidence, the elemental’s light glowing faintly beneath her skin, a constant reminder of the power she now held.

As they descended into the safety of the underground bunker, Raen glanced back at the shattered stones. The light of the elementals had faded, but the power they had given her remained. She knew she would return, not just to survive the storms, but to master the power they had bestowed upon her.

After all, how could she resist the pull of gravity—both the storm’s and her own newfound strength?

How does this version align with your vision?

##### You said:

Yes. Now remove the underground bunker. Instead, have a stormwall between the gravity storm and Raen. This stormwall is made of stone with gravity stones embedded into it. Gravity stones are very good building materials and the bigger ones aren't easily picked up by the storm. The ones that shatter are smaller and can be thrown in the wind. Gravity stones are created by stone condensing due to the forces of the gravity storm.

Every twenty-one hours, Esderrus passed overhead, bringing with it chaos and destruction. But this time, the air crackled with a different energy—something deeper, more primal. The storm wasn’t just coming; it was about to unleash something extraordinary.

Raen’s eyes were drawn to the horizon, where the first signs of the tempest were visible. The earth groaned under the strain, distant mountains splitting open to release molten rock and ash into the sky. The sea below her churned, waves crashing violently against the jagged rocks far below. Gravity had already begun to weaken, a strange lightness creeping through her limbs. Each step felt unnaturally long, each breath too easy. This was the calm before the storm’s true fury.

The stormwall stood tall between Raen and the chaos, a massive barrier of stone embedded with gravity stones. These stones, dark and smooth like polished obsidian, pulsed with veins of glowing crystal—white, green, blue, and red. The wall had been built to withstand the fury of the gravity storms, its foundations sunk deep into the earth, the stones fused into an immovable fortress. The larger gravity stones were particularly valuable, their density and weight making them impervious to the storm’s pull.

But the smaller stones, those that had formed from the recent storms, were different. They weren’t as deeply embedded, their grip on the wall tenuous. Raen watched as the storm’s approach began to dislodge them, the air shimmering as the stones twisted in the strange, light-defying patterns of gravity distortion.

As the winds howled and the ground trembled, Raen’s attention was captured by the falling boulders. Massive stones, pulled from the mountains by the storm’s fury, hurtled through the sky. These weren’t just any rocks; they were gravity stones, their dark surfaces gleaming like obsidian, veined with light that pulsed in time with the storm.

The stones hung in the air for a brief, surreal moment, their strange beauty mesmerizing. Then, with a sound like the crack of thunder, the stones collided. The impact sent shockwaves through the air, and Raen watched in awe as the stones shattered, fragments flying in all directions.

From the heart of the shattered stones, something began to emerge. Light poured from the fragments, coalescing into forms that were not quite physical, yet undeniably present.

The first to take shape was the white elemental, its body composed of swirling light, its form shifting and ethereal. It hovered in the air before Raen, its eyes—if they could be called that—gleaming with an ancient, unknowable intelligence.

As the white elemental took form, three others emerged from the shards around it. The first was green, vibrant and pulsing like the heart of a living forest. The second was blue, deep and fluid, like the essence of the ocean itself. The third was red, fierce and flickering, like a living flame.

The elementals seemed to pulse with life, their energies swirling and mixing in the air. Then, with a sudden, fluid motion, the green, blue, and red elementals began to drift toward the white one. Their lights intertwined, merging together into a brilliant, blinding glow.

Raen felt a surge of power as the colored elementals merged completely with the white one, their combined energy intensifying, growing stronger. The white elemental, now infused with the power of all three, turned its gaze to Raen.

It moved toward her, its light pulsing with an irresistible energy. Raen could feel the connection between them, a bond forming that went beyond the physical. As the elemental reached out, its light touched her chest, and she gasped as the energy flowed into her. The power filled her, overwhelming yet exhilarating, as if she had become one with the storm itself.

Kazran’s voice broke through the rush of power. “Raen! We need to move!”

His voice was tight with urgency, but Raen was no longer afraid. She could feel the power of the elemental within her, its energy thrumming in her veins, a part of her now.

“I’m not the same, Kazran,” she said, her voice steady despite the chaos. “This power—it’s mine now.”

As the storm raged on, the ground shaking beneath them, Raen and Kazran moved away from the cliff’s edge, the stormwall at their backs. The elementals' light glowed faintly beneath her skin, a constant reminder of the power she now held. The wall remained firm, a silent guardian against the storm, its stones unyielding except for the ones that had given their essence to Raen.

Raen glanced back at the shattered stones. The light of the elementals had faded, but the power they had given her remained. She knew she would return, not just to survive the storms, but to master the power they had bestowed upon her.

After all, how could she resist the pull of gravity—both the storm’s and her own newfound strength?

**Gravity’s Maw**

The wind was brisk as it rippled across the surface of Midium Lake. The dock and two large ships on either side of Averian swayed gently back and forth like a mother cradling her baby. His short, light brown hair ruffled slightly in the wind. Averian stared down at his distorted reflection in the water, his sad blue-green eyes imperceptible in the shimmering reflection of those sapphire depths.

The water had been calm a moment earlier. To the west, a large green and blue moon arched over the horizon. The continent closest to Donovus had seven concentric rings dug into it—the Verithian Rings, home of Verithinus, Averian’s god.

Esderrus was large in the sky. Averian held one hand out toward it. While the sun was the size of his thumbnail, Esderrus was a ball that fit in his hand. The docks shuddered.

A gravity storm was about to start. Averian knew he should head home, away from the dock he sat on, yet he remained sitting, clutching the silvery blue locket in his hand. His legs dangled off the side of the dock as the tide began to rise. The water was still well below the line on the dock that only the worst gravity storms would pass. Averian’s eyes shifted to the nearby shoreline, where water began flowing into the irrigation ditches and canals.

Luckily, this wasn’t a major gravity storm. Averian could stay out in it. The gravity storm during the coming night, in the stormcast hours of the morning—that was a death sentence.

The full force of the gravity storm wouldn’t occur for another thirteen minutes. The gravity storms were regular. They lasted eighty minutes, with fifty-four minutes at full force.

The two large ships on either side were attached to the docks by heavy-duty mooring lines. In this sheltered bay, a stormwall rose to the west to protect the docks from any stray boulders the storm threw up. The ships were weighed down by gravity stones, the perfect anchors in this storm-tossed land.

Averian glanced back into the water below. It was like glancing off a cliff. Crystals gleamed green, white, and blue at the end of chains below, surrounded by black, obsidian-like rock. Those were the gravity stones used as anchors. The docks had to be built well above the water. Reinforced staircases made of oak and gravity stones veined with various crystal light normally led down to the boats moored below. They had been stored beneath the dock by the dockhands.

Meanwhile, Raen stood at the edge of a cliff far from the lake, the ground beneath her feet trembling as the sky darkened. Esderrus loomed overhead, its green and blue surface a vast presence that seemed to pull at the very essence of Donovus. The gravity storm was coming, more powerful than any she had faced before, and Raen could feel it in her bones.

Every twenty-one hours, Esderrus passed overhead, bringing with it chaos and destruction. But this time, the air crackled with a different energy—something deeper, more primal. The storm wasn’t just coming; it was about to unleash something extraordinary.

Meanwhile, Averian remained at the dock, lost in his thoughts as the gravity storm reached its full force. The dock shuddered, but it held strong, anchored by the gravity stones below. The ships swayed, but they too were secure, tethered by the same stones that had given Raen her power.

The storm raged on, but for both Raen and Averian, it was more than just a natural disaster—it was a force that shaped their world, and their destinies.
