# Raen (Off the Simola coast)

Raen braced herself as the ground quivered beneath her. The familiar tremors heralded the approach of Esderrus, far above her. The vast green and blue moon loomed, like a vast, living god, pulling at Donovus with an ancient, unyielding force. A relentless, unseen hand. This gravity storm would be stronger than those before it—a force of nature that promised both destruction and, perhaps, something more.

Every twenty-one hours, the world braced for the chaos that followed Esderrus's passing. But this time, the air crackled with a different energy. Something deeper, more primal. One that buzzed against Raen’s skin and made her heart race.  The air was thick with tension, an electric charge that danced along her skin, making every hair stand on end. The storm would be fierce, more powerful than anything she'd faced before, and Raen knew she needed to be ready. The storm wasn’t just coming—it was on the brink of breaking loose. It was about to unleash something extraordinary.

Standing on the cliff’s edge, Raen looked out over the roiling black sea. The water churned and boiled. Waves crashed furiously against the jagged rocks below, as if the ocean itself was trying to claw its way free of the storm’s grasp. Already, gravity was weakening, a strange lightness creeping into her limbs. The familiar half-gravity always unsettled her, making her steps feel too long, her leaps too high, her breath too easy. The sensation was unsettling, but it was the calm before the world was torn asunder.

Raen’s eyes darted to the horizon, where the first signs of the coming tempest appeared. The land itself seemed to bow under the pressure, the rocks groaning as the earth began to heave. Distant mountains cracked open, spewing molten rock and ash into the sky. The earth itself was coming apart, and yet Raen felt something stir within her—a pull, an instinct she couldn’t quite place.

"Hold fast!"  the voice of her mentor, Kazran, cut through the rising winds. The older man stood firm, his eyes locked on the distant chaos. He had weathered more storms than Raen could count,  his body and spirit forged by the relentless trials of Donovus. “This is the fourth pass. It’ll be worse than before.”

 Raen nodded, though her mouth was dry with fear. She had only been through one of these stronger storms, and even then, she had barely survived. The memory of the earth splitting beneath her feet, the world itself tearing apart, was still fresh in her mind. But this time, she wasn’t just a victim of the storm. This time, she was ready.

 As Esderrus neared, the world seemed to teeter on the edge of oblivion. Gravity weakened further, and Raen felt herself growing lighter, her boots barely clinging to the earth. But this lightness was not a gift—it was a harbinger of destruction.

The stormwall stood tall between Raen and the chaos, a massive barrier of stone embedded with gravity stones. These stones, dark and smooth like polished obsidian, pulsed with veins of glowing crystal—white, green, blue, and red. The wall had been built to withstand the fury of the gravity storms, its foundations sunk deep into the earth, the stones fused into an immovable fortress. The larger gravity stones were particularly valuable, their density and weight making them impervious to the storm’s pull.

But the smaller stones, those that had formed from the recent storms, were different. They weren’t as deeply embedded, their grip on the wall tenuous. Raen watched as the storm’s approach began to dislodge them, the air shimmering as the stones twisted in the strange, light-defying patterns of gravity distortion.

The storm  struck with a ferocity that nearly sent her sprawling. The ground bucked beneath her, and she clung to a nearby boulder, holding on as the earth rolled like the sea in a storm. Trees were wrenched from the soil, tossed into the air by the chaotic gravity.

And then the stones began to fall.

Raen’s breath caught as massive boulders were lifted and hurled back to the ground with terrifying force. Where they struck, the earth shattered, and from the ruins emerged something extraordinary—gravity stones.

They were beautiful, in a terrifying way. Spheres of blackness, as if they had been cut from the void itself, with veins of light that pulsed with life. White, green, blue—each stone flickered with its own strange energy, bending the light around it in ways that defied reason. The air around them shimmered, light bending and distorting, creating an eerie halo that made Raen’s skin crawl. Raen felt a pull toward them, a connection she had always known but never understood.

The stones hung in the air for a brief, surreal moment, their strange beauty mesmerizing, their dark surfaces gleaming like obsidian, veined with light that pulsed in time with the storm. Each stone was perfectly spherical, except for the veins of glowing crystal that ran through them, bending the light in strange and wondrous ways. The veins shimmered in different colors—white, green, blue, and red—each glowing with an inner light that seemed almost alive.

With a sound like the crack of thunder, the stones collided. The impact sent shockwaves through the air, and Raen watched in awe as the stones shattered, obsidian-like fragments flying in all directions. But instead of falling to the ground, the shards of the stones seemed to hang suspended, held aloft by an unseen force.

From the heart of the shattered stones, something began to emerge. Light poured from the fragments, coalescing into forms that were not quite physical, yet undeniably present.

 The white light coalesced into a figure—no, not a figure, but something more primal, more elemental. It was a spirit, a being of pure energy, its form shifting and twisting like smoke in the wind. It was ethereal. It hovered before her, its eyes—if they could be called that—gleaming with an ancient intelligence. As it drifted closer, three others emerged from the shards around it. The first was green, vibrant and pulsing like the heart of a living forest. The second was blue, deep and fluid, like the essence of the ocean itself. The third was red, fierce and flickering, like a living flame.
 
Raen’s breath caught in her throat as the spirits circled her, their energies pulsing in time with the storm. She should have been afraid, but instead, she felt something else—an understanding, a recognition.

The elementals seemed to pulse with life, their energies swirling and mixing in the air. Then, with a sudden, fluid motion, the green, blue, and red elementals began to drift toward the white one. Their lights intertwined, merging together into a brilliant, blinding glow.

The white elemental, now infused with the power of all three, turned its gaze to Raen. It moved toward her, its light pulsing with an irresistible energy. Raen could feel the connection between them, a bond forming that went beyond the physical. The connection was immediate, like a key turning in a lock. As the elemental reached out, its light touched her chest, and she gasped as the energy flowed into her. The power filled her, overwhelming yet exhilarating, as if she had become one with the storm itself.  It filled her with a power that was as vast as the storm itself. The world around her faded, leaving only the elementals and the raw energy they had gifted her.

Kazran’s shout broke through the haze. “Raen! We need to move!”

His voice was urgent, filled with fear as he watched the spirits binding themselves to her. But Raen was no longer afraid. She could feel the power within her, the energy of the elementals coursing through her veins.

She reached out to an unbroken gravity stone, her fingers brushing the surface of the smaller stone that had rolled to her feet. It was warm to the touch, heavier than it looked, with a strange pull that made her feel both grounded and adrift. The veins of light within it pulsed rhythmically, like a heartbeat, and for a moment, she felt a connection—something ancient and powerful, as if the stone held the secrets of the universe within its core. As her fingers brushed its warm surface, the light within the stone pulsed brighter, as if responding to her touch. She closed her eyes, focusing on the light, drawing it into herself. The energy flowed into her, filling her with a power that was both exhilarating and terrifying.

She turned to him, her eyes glowing with the light of the spirits within her. “I’m not the same, Kazran,” she whispered, her voice steady despite the chaos. “I can feel it—this power, it’s mine.”

But there was no time to linger. The storm was still raging, the ground shaking beneath them. Raen and Kazran moved away from the cliff’s edge, the stormwall at their backs. Raen’s steps sure and steady despite the chaos around her. The wall remained firm, a silent guardian against the storm, its stones unyielding except for the ones that had given their essence to Raen. The spirits remained within her, their power thrumming in her veins.

Raen glanced back at the shattered stones. The light of the elementals had faded, but the power they had given her remained. She knew she would return, not just to survive the storms, but to master the power they had bestowed upon her.
 
 After all, how could she resist the pull of gravity—both the storm’s and her own newfound power?

It was more than just a natural disaster—it was a force that shaped the world, and the destinies of those on it.
