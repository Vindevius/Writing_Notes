**Carvula** are delicate, deer-like creatures inhabiting the forests of Aramus. Here’s a detailed description:
- **Carvula Stags**:
    - **Size and Build**: Carvula stags are elegant, stag-like creatures with a graceful build. They are slightly larger than the Carvula does, with sturdy yet slender legs suited for swift movement through the forest.

    - **Fur**: Their fur is soft and dense, ranging in color from rich browns to subtle grays, blending seamlessly with the forest floor and underbrush. The fur provides insulation and helps them adapt to the varying temperatures of their environment.

- **Carvula Does**:
    - **Size and Build**: Carvula does are similar to Carvula stags in build but are slightly smaller and more delicate in appearance. They possess a sleek, graceful body with a refined, slender frame.
    - **Fur**: Their fur is similarly soft and dense, with colors that range from light tans to soft browns, providing effective camouflage in the dappled light of the forest.
    - **Behavior**: Carvula does, like their stag counterparts, are herbivorous and are typically found grazing or foraging in small groups. They exhibit a nurturing behavior, often seen caring for their young in the protective cover of the forest.
- **Habitat**: Carvula thrive in the dense, lush forests of Aramus, where they navigate through the underbrush and tall vegetation with ease. They are an integral part of the forest ecosystem, contributing to the balance of plant life and serving as prey for larger predators.
