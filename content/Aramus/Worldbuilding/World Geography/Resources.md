- Domerium: A rare metal that is resistant to the Aurusoren’s venom. It means metal of eternal power. It’s silver blue in color. Its extremely low density, strength, and resistance to corrosion make it a highly sought-after metal. It is commonly used to make a strong domerium-steel alloy that can only be forged by all three divisions of the Order of Elements working together.
- Ophuris - A combination of oil, sulfur, and resin that bursts into flame on impact. (Inspired by Greek Fire). It burns in water and is difficult to put out. Created by Evolan by mistake in his experiments with explosives. Specifically, when his cache of explosives destroyed part of Tirvalis’s city wall.
- Red-hot Sand- Sand heated to the point of extreme burning pain.
- Atrulvis: “Black Powder” Gunpowder. 75% saltpeter (potassium nitrate), 10% sulfur, 15% charcoal.
- Sodium Hydroxide - formed when sodium meets water. A concentrated solution can dissolve flesh within an hour.
- Sodium-potassium alloy - Evolan uses it in his explosives in conjunction with water. The explosives break a barrier between water and the alloy when activated. The alloy is kept in oil in a container surrounded by water. The technology to create sodium and potassium does not exist in the world outside of the Order of Elements’ abilities. Notable explosives include fragmentation, shockwaves, and fire. The latter was created by mistake.
