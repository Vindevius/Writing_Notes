## Cost
Lightshield - 7 gravity stones for vitals, 14 for full body shield. 4 for body, 3 for head, 3 for arms, 4 for legs.

## Adaivas
- Multiple veridion can't combine. They can only combine with three ROYGBIV adaiva.
- A corudrax cannot peacefully coincide with a veridion bonded to the same person. It is possible for them both to be present, granting the user both Praevaltus and Corudus powers, however, eventually one will destroy the other based on the user's decisions.
- If a veridion has only bonded with one adaiva, other adaivas, when shattered nearby, may attempt to bond with it.
- If, in the case of Vecormus powers, someone only has colored adaivas bonded, a veridion or corudrax can still bond with that person and their current colors. The person can prevent this bond if they make a conscious effort to reject the bond.
- Black gravity stones are like black holes. They turn nearby gravity stones into black gravity stones.
- Each adaiva has a name:
	- White adaiva are called Veridion.
	- Red adaiva are called Domarion.
	- Orange adaiva are called Vesorin.
	- Yellow adaiva are called Calvorion ~~Medathor~~.
	- Green adaiva are called Virosa.
	- Blue adaiva are called Narionis.
	- Indigo adaiva are called Soveldor.
	- Violet adaiva are called Aeonaris.
	- Black adaiva are called Corudrax.

## [[Adaiva Titans]]
- When a gravity stone larger than a boulder shatters, it creates an adaiva titan. These titans are forces of pure destructive power, especially if paired with a corudrax.
- They represent one of the seven orders of power. If alone, they are more neutral, but when bonded with a veridion or corudrax, they tend to the characteristics of praevaltus or corudus.
