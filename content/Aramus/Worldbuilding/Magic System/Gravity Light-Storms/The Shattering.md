- The powers of Praevaltus, Vecormus, and Corudus come to people in a process called the Shattering. When gravity stones collide, there is a chance that they will shatter. When they do, they create a unique creature that bonds with the nearest person of the seven races. This bond allows the power of the creature to flow through that person. The type of power depends on which colored gravity stones shatter.
- When white shatters with other colors, it creates Praevaltus. When black, which is unnatural, shatters with other colors, it creates corudus. The colors shattering without either of those two gravity stones create Vecormus, since they have a lesser power.
- The type of power given depends on which colored gravity stones shatter. A person can only have 3 powers given to them in this way.
