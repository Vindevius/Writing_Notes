Gravity stones would have unique and varying effects on different types of terrain based on their density, behavior during storms, and how they interact with the environment. Here's a detailed look at their potential impact on plains, hills, mountains, swamps, lakes, and rivers:

---

### **1. Plains**

- **Effects**:
    - Gravity stones would likely embed themselves into the soil, creating dense clusters where they fall frequently.
    - Over time, these clusters could affect soil structure, making it more compact and less fertile for agriculture.
    - The glowing veins in gravity stones might create eerie or beautiful "light fields" during storms.
- **Long-term Impact**:
    - Plains could become areas rich in gravity stone deposits, encouraging mining activity.
    - Stones might alter local ecosystems, as plants and animals adapt to their presence, potentially leading to new forms of flora and fauna.

### **2. Hills**

- **Effects**:
    - Gravity stones might roll down slopes after landing, gathering at the base of hills and forming "stone belts."
    - Over time, the heavy stones could erode the soil more quickly, reshaping the hills and creating steeper or irregular slopes.
- **Long-term Impact**:
    - Hills could develop into natural barriers or landmarks due to stone accumulations.
    - Communities might use these natural deposits for resource gathering or as defensive positions.

### **3. Mountains**

- **Effects**:
    - Gravity stones might embed themselves in rock faces, altering the structural integrity of cliffs and peaks.
    - Their heavy weight and high density could trigger rockslides or avalanches, especially during or after a storm.
- **Long-term Impact**:
    - Mountains might become "gravity stone quarries," with large-scale operations extracting stones for use in construction or technology.
    - Glacial regions could accumulate stones at their bases as they slide downhill, creating gravity-stone moraines.

### **4. Swamps**

- **Effects**:
    - Gravity stones would sink quickly into the waterlogged ground, forming dense layers beneath the swamp.
    - The glowing light from submerged stones might create ghostly, luminescent effects in the murky waters.
- **Long-term Impact**:
    - The stones could harden the swamp floor over time, altering drainage patterns and potentially transforming parts of the swamp into solid ground.
    - Their presence might foster unique ecosystems with creatures or plants adapted to high gravity or glowing environments.

### **5. Lakes**

- **Effects**:
    - Gravity stones would sink to the lakebed, forming dense deposits over time.
    - The glow of the stones might create stunning underwater light shows, visible from the surface at night.
    - Falling stones during storms could disturb aquatic ecosystems, potentially harming fish and other organisms.
- **Long-term Impact**:
    - Lakes could become sources of valuable gravity stones, attracting divers and miners.
    - If stones alter the lake's gravity field significantly, it might impact water circulation, leading to temperature changes or new currents.

### **6. Rivers**

- **Effects**:
    - Gravity stones would sink to the riverbed and could be carried downstream, creating deposits in slower-moving or wider sections.
    - Smaller rivers might experience blockages from stone build-ups, altering their courses or creating new floodplains.
- **Long-term Impact**:
    - Gravity stone deposits could form natural dams, creating lakes or wetlands upstream.
    - River channels might become legendary routes for treasure hunters seeking to follow the flow of stones to larger deposits downstream.

### **General Implications**

1. **Ecosystem Evolution**:
    
    - Plants and animals might evolve to use gravity stones, with bioluminescent plants, high-gravity-adapted creatures, or animals that camouflage against the glowing stones.
    - Gravity stones could create "stone zones" with unique biomes influenced by their gravity-modifying effects.
2. **Human Settlements**:
    
    - Communities might form near areas rich in gravity stones, such as plains or lakes, to mine and harness their energy.
    - Cultural significance might arise, with certain regions using the stones for rituals, landmarks, or trade.
3. **Geological Effects**:
    
    - Over centuries, gravity stones could influence tectonic activity, with dense deposits creating unique fault lines or altering erosion patterns.

### **Oceans**

Gravity stones would likely have a profound effect on the oceans over time, depending on their buoyancy, density, and how they interact with the environment. Here's an analysis of how gravity stones might influence the oceans of Daivara:

---

### **Key Considerations**

1. **Density of Gravity Stones**:  
    With an average density of **22.59 g/cm³**, gravity stones are far denser than typical oceanic materials (e.g., water at 1 g/cm³ or basalt at 3 g/cm³). This means:
    
    - Gravity stones would sink rapidly to the seafloor, accumulating over time.
    - The stones would primarily affect areas with relatively calm water or deep basins, where they wouldn't be moved by currents or tectonic activity.
2. **Volume of Stonefall Over Time**:  
    Using your estimated density of **1.33 billion stones per storm**:
    
    - If a significant portion (say, 70%) of the stones falls into the oceans (as they cover most of Daivara’s surface), this results in **931 million stones per storm entering the oceans**.
    - Over centuries or millennia, this could lead to massive deposits of gravity stones on the ocean floor.
3. **Ocean Dynamics**:
    
    - **Currents and Tides**: Gravity stones might cluster in areas with weaker currents or settle in abyssal plains, creating fields or ridges of stones.
    - **Erosion and Sediment Accumulation**: Over time, sediment could bury older gravity stones, forming stratified layers beneath the ocean floor.
4. **Impact on Marine Life**:
    
    - **Immediate Effects**: Falling stones might disrupt marine ecosystems, killing organisms in their path or altering habitats on the ocean floor.
    - **Long-term Effects**: Gravity stones might reshape ecosystems, creating niches for new species adapted to high-gravity environments or areas of unusual mineral composition.
5. **Human and Societal Factors**:
    
    - **Harvesting Operations**: People on Daivara might develop technologies to retrieve gravity stones from the ocean floor, potentially using advanced diving techniques, submersibles, or gravity-manipulating devices.
    - **Marine "Graveyards"**: Some areas might become so dense with stones that they form underwater fields akin to coral reefs but made of gravity stones.

### **Would They Fill the Oceans?**

While gravity stones could accumulate significantly on the ocean floor, it’s unlikely they would "fill" the oceans entirely. Oceans are vast and deep, and even with billions of stones falling over millennia, the volume of the oceans far exceeds the cumulative volume of gravity stones.

1. **Volume of Oceans on Earth (For Comparison)**:
    
    - Earth's oceans have a volume of approximately **1.332 billion cubic kilometers**. Daivara’s oceans might be similar.
2. **Estimated Stone Volume**:
    
    - If 931 million stones fall into the oceans per storm and each storm happens every 21 hours:
        - Over one year, approximately **4.07 trillion stones** could fall into the oceans.
        - Assuming each gravity stone is a sphere with a radius of **10 cm**, its volume would be: V=43πr3=43π(0.1)3=0.00419 m3V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi (0.1)^3 = 0.00419 \, \text{m}^3V=34​πr3=34​π(0.1)3=0.00419m3
            
            - Total volume of stones per year:
            
            4.07 trillion×0.00419 m3=17.06 cubic kilometers4.07 \, \text{trillion} \times 0.00419 \, \text{m}^3 = 17.06 \, \text{cubic kilometers}4.07trillion×0.00419m3=17.06cubic kilometers
        - Over 1,000 years: **~17,060 km³** of stone in the oceans.
3. **Proportion of Ocean Volume**:
    
    - Over 1,000 years, gravity stones would occupy only **~0.0013%** of the ocean's total volume, assuming Earth-like oceans.

### **Long-Term Effects**

1. **Geological Impact**: Over geological timescales, gravity stones could become part of the oceanic crust, sinking deeper through subduction zones or contributing to seamounts and other underwater structures.
2. **Gravitational Effects**: With their high density, gravity stones could subtly alter local gravity fields, impacting ocean currents and tides.
3. **Ocean Floor Evolution**: Gravity stones might form vast underwater deposits, eventually influencing the ocean's topography and chemistry.
