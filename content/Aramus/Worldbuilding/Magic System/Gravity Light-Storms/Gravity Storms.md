Every 21 hours Esderrus passes by overhead, bringing a gravity storm. Every 4 passes or 3 days, a stronger gravity storm occurs. They last 80 minutes. 13 minutes on either side of the storm is lesser, with 54 minutes in the middle at full force.

A gravity storm consists of earthquakes, volcanic activity, higher tides, etc... Gravity is at 50% during a gravity storm.

During a gravity storm, the gravity is halved on Daivara. After the more powerful gravity storms, gravity compacts boulders and rocks into gravity stones. These crystallized stones vary in size from small pebbles and large stones. The gravity stones are dark in color, almost like obsidian, with glowing veins of crystal. The glowing veins of crystal vary in color. Light distorts around the stone. The stones are perfectly spherical, outside of the glowing crystals.

A gravity stone has a density of 22.59 g/cm3 (Osmium). A 4 inch circumference stone is 1 lb. A 9 inch circumference stone is 10 lbs. The average gravity stone is 2.5 inch circumference with a weight of 0.22 lbs or 97.68 grams.

The powers of Praevaltus, Corudus, and Vecormus use gravity stones to fuel them. 

The Light's color is dependent on the following scale from common to rare:
- White - 21% (2100/10000)
- Green - 19.98% (1998/10000) (25.30%)
- Blue - 15.99% (1599/10000) (20.24%)
- Yellow - 12.8% (1280/10000) (16.21%)
- Indigo - 10.24% (1024/10000) (12.96%)
- Orange - 8.19% (819/10000) (10.37%)
- Red - 6.55% (655/10000) (8.29%)
- Violet - 5.24% (524/10000) (6.63%)
- Black (has a unique creation) - 0.01% (1/10000)
Each color represents a specific power.
- White - Verithinus/Praevaltus
- Green - Life
- Blue - Nature
- Yellow - Volition
- Indigo - Wisdom
- Orange - Travel
- Red - Strength
- Violet - Eternity
- Black - Corudus
