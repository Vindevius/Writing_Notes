## The Creation of Praevaltus & Corudus:

- Praevaltus Elari - Praeveros near Monticus in the Everlasting Mountains
	- increased wisdom and power over nature
- Praevaltus Fausors - Vetanisolas within Alduncus
	- increased strength and decreased height
- Praevaltus Torvaltus - Vetanvium within Wilddeep Acropolis
	- increased abilities over nature in a capacity related to the person
- Corudus Tenilari - Dark Elari. Coruveros near Wraithmoor.
	- Same powers as the Elari, but weakened
- Corudus Maluculus - Tenisolas near Abisusolas
	- similar to Fausors, except shorter and weaker. Very nimble.
- Corudus Gorcin - Tenianvium near Abisusolas
	- orc-like in appearance, similar to Torvaltus
- Corudus Malac - Abisusolas within Torbanum
	- makes anything evil
- Praevaltus Angeum - Luxurus near Phoenix Bay
	- makes anything good
- Malefic Aldun - Devil Deep. Where Lunisian went and became Morthadim and took control of all Malefic. He guards it heavily.
- Vetanius Praevaltus - Ancient Enhanced that's lived for over two centuries
- Arcluni are the result of the powers of Corudus, while Capri are the result of Praevaltus.
- The Elari
- Born through immersion in Praeveros (the Waters of Enhancement) or if their parents were already Elari.
- After immersion, the body goes through a rapid cellular change. They gain a higher capacity to understand and see things clearly. They become naturally agile. Most also develop telepathy.
- The Elari are the primary Dragon Riders as Dragons tend towards bonding with those with telepathy.
- The Fausors
	- Born within Alduncus.
- The Adaiva
	- Born through Vetanvium.
- The Angeum

## The Lazari

- Born through Abisusolas

## The Maluculi

- The Maluculi were the corudus counterpart of the fausor.
- They have pale gray skin and can see in pitch darkness.
- They are three feet tall with curly black hair and a row of sharp canine teeth.
- They prefer dark places such as Torbanum and hate the light. Although, Morthadim has been able to have Maluculi fight in the light. Only the maluculi he’s turned into his pawns will be willing to do this.
- They were created in the depths of Torbanum.
- They are almost mindless beasts.

## The Gorcin

The Malac

## Dragons

- Dragons are the primary sentient species on Daivara before humans arrived.
- While in their eggs, they can sense their surroundings in such a way that they know exactly when to hatch. These eggs can stay dormant for centuries before hatching and are nearly indestructible. The shell is hard and looks like it’s encrusted with jewels, yet the shell is very smooth. When the egg is about to hatch it becomes very hot (or cold depending on the type of dragon). If the egg is forced open, the dragon will immediately fly away to safety. If the egg is being carried away by those with evil intent, as the dragons can also sense this in the egg, the dragon will hatch and try to escape.
- When dragons sense it is time to hatch, they hatch in a few different ways. Those that breathe fire (Dratoigmus), tend to shake the egg and crack slowly before sending the eggshell in all directions. Ice breathing dragons (Dratoglasus) on the other hand, tend to explode immediately. There are also a few rare species of dragons, including lightning, poison, and water. The main two dragon types are fire and ice.
- Dragons, when born, are about two feet long. They grow quickly to about 12 ft long over the course of two months. After this initial growth spurt, they grow much slower, about a foot a year. Their seventh year they grow two feet. After about 10 years they reach their max length of around 24 ft. There are some rare exceptions to this rule. There is a dragon that’s known to be 50 ft in length.
- In order to fly, they have to have a running start. If they jump from a high place, it is much easier to take flight.
- Dragons are fairly slender creatures as well.
- Three types of Dragons created by the three different powers. The Valdrae of Praevaltus, the Corudrae of Corudus, and the Vecordrae of Vecormus. Dragons come from Drakes.

## Aurusoren

- The Aurusoren or Golden Serpent is a rare dragon-like creature, which is very venomous. Morthadim’s Aurusoren is 100 meters or 300 feet long, which is extremely unnatural for Aurusoren. Most of them only grow to be up to 30 meters or about 100 feet long. The Aurusoren in The Defenders of Aramus was believed to be the last of its kind. The only reason it still lives is due to dark magic. The second one, that appears in The Maze of Monsters, was created by two of the children of the other Aurusoren. This Aurusoren grows to be half the size of the original Aurusoren, still larger than normal. It is kept alive through dark magic. When that dark magic is destroyed, both are destroyed.
- It comes from a sorenculi.

## Arcluni

- The Arcluni, also known as werewolves, are people that are able to transform into a wolf-like humanoid creature. They can turn into this creature anytime when the light of a moon is above. Whenever the silver moon is full they must transform except under rare cases when the Arclunus’ infection was stopped at a certain point. Under the silver moon, they tend to lose all control unless the previously mentioned case. During any other transformation, they remain mostly in control.
- When they transform, they grow hair all over their bodies and their face turns into a small snout. They grow sharp claws and their hands and feet become more like paws. Unlike Capri, when they transform back almost none of these things remain. They tend to be hairier than most people.
- They are typically aggressive.

## Capri

- The Capri are people that are able to transform into goat-like people. They can turn into this creature any time the sun is up. They have to do it at least once a day. Unlike with arcluni, this can’t be stopped, but they have complete control minus some urges to chew on everything.
- When they transform, the person grows short, curly horns, their pupils become horizontal slits, and their feet turn into foot-length hooves. They also grow a massive amount of hair, especially on their legs. When they transform back, the horns and hooves remain.
- Capri can be born with these looks if their parents are both Capri. Chris was a Capri from birth.
- Capri are created when another Capri bites someone or draws blood while transformed. Similar to a werewolf.
