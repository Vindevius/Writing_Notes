**External Characteristics:**
1. **Aeonaris**:
    - **Fast Time Bubble**: Creates a localized field where time moves faster than in the outside environment. This allows the user to act more quickly relative to others, giving them a temporal advantage in situations requiring rapid responses.
		- **Description**: A Fast Time Bubble is a specialized time manipulation effect that accelerates the passage of time within a defined area or sphere. Unlike slow time bubbles that slow down time, a fast time bubble compresses time, causing it to pass more quickly for everything inside the bubble compared to the outside world.
		- **Effects**:
		    - **Accelerated Time**: Everything within the bubble experiences time at a much faster rate. For example, a few minutes inside the bubble might equate to hours or even days outside of it.
		    - **Rapid Changes**: Processes such as aging, growth, and decay occur more quickly within the bubble. This can be used to hasten healing or development but may also lead to accelerated aging or deterioration.
		    - **Perception**: Individuals inside the bubble perceive time as normal but are affected by the rapid passage of events, which may be disorienting or overwhelming once they leave the bubble.
		    - **Duration and Control**: The duration and control over the bubble's effects can vary depending on the strength and mastery of the user. The user can expand or contract the bubble, affecting a larger or smaller area as needed.
		- **Applications**:
		    - **Combat**: Useful for speeding up actions and reactions in combat situations, giving the user a tactical advantage.
		    - **Healing**: Can accelerate healing processes or the recovery of skills, though this might come with side effects depending on the severity and context.
		    - **Development**: Facilitates rapid development or growth of objects, plants, or individuals within the bubble, potentially leading to advanced technology or accelerated research.
			**Fast Time Bubble** offers a strategic advantage by altering the flow of time, impacting everything within its sphere, and is a powerful tool in both combat and other high-stakes scenarios.
    - **Show Visions of Death**: Projects visions specifically related to death or fatal outcomes. These visions can reveal potential threats, dangers, or the consequences of actions, focusing on the darker aspects of the future.
    - **Show Nightmares**: Induces or displays nightmares, creating intense and unsettling dream-like experiences. This can be used to frighten or destabilize individuals by making them confront their deepest fears.

	    - **Emotional Manipulation**: By planting feelings, the user can subtly or overtly manipulate how someone feels about a situation or another person. This can be used to sway opinions, elicit particular reactions, or control emotional responses.
	    - **Empathic Influence**: The power may also allow the user to create a shared emotional experience, making others feel what the user wants them to feel. This can be useful in creating empathy, building connections, or causing distress.
		- **Subtle or Direct Impact**: The intensity and subtlety of the emotions can vary. The user can choose to implant mild emotional nudges or more intense feelings, depending on their goal.
    - **Lies**: Allows the user to detect falsehoods and deceit. It grants the ability to discern when someone is being dishonest, revealing hidden truths or lies.
3. **Strength**:

	    - **Infusion of Rage**:
		    - **Description**: The power allows the user to imbue objects with a state of rage. This means that objects can be made to act aggressively or destructively, as if they were fueled by anger.
		- **Aggressive Behavior**:
		    - **Description**: Once an object is imbued with rage, it can exhibit aggressive behaviors. For example, a weapon might attack with increased ferocity, a piece of furniture might break apart violently, or a vehicle could drive erratically.
		- **Enhanced Impact**:
		    - **Description**: Objects affected by rage can cause greater damage when used or interacted with. For instance, a shield imbued with rage could deal heavy impacts when struck, or a thrown object might have increased force and destructive potential.

		- **Rage Duration**:
		    - **Description**: The intensity and duration of the rage effect can vary. Some objects might remain enraged for a short period, while others could sustain their aggressive behavior for longer, depending on the user's control over the power.
		- **Physical and Visual Effects**:
		    - **Description**: Objects under the influence of rage might exhibit visual or physical changes, such as glowing with a fiery aura, vibrating, or emitting ominous sounds. These effects signal the heightened aggression and instability of the object.
		- **Strategic Use**:
