Progression in the powers of Praevaltus could be influenced by several factors, both external and internal. Here are some possible causes for someone to progress in their powers:

### 1. **Exposure to Gravity Light**:

- **Intensity and Duration**: The more a person is exposed to gravity light from gravity stones, the faster their powers may grow. Prolonged exposure or exposure to higher-intensity gravity light could accelerate this progression.
- **Type of Gravity Stone**: Different gravity stones might enhance different aspects of Praevaltus powers. For example, exposure to Veridion (white) stones might specifically enhance powers related to time manipulation or vision.

### 2. **Training and Practice**:

- **Focused Training**: Regular and focused practice of their abilities could lead to natural progression. The more a person practices specific powers, the more refined and potent those powers become.
- **Mentorship**: Guidance from a more experienced individual with Praevaltus powers could help unlock higher levels of power more quickly, providing techniques or insights that might not be discovered independently.

### 3. **Emotional and Psychological States**:

- **Emotional Intensity**: Strong emotions, such as anger, fear, or love, might trigger sudden increases in power, especially during moments of crisis. These emotional surges can unlock latent abilities or push existing powers to new levels.
- **Mental Focus**: A calm and focused mind might allow for greater control and precision, leading to a more gradual and consistent progression in power.

### 4. **Spiritual or Mystical Experiences**:

- **Rituals or Ceremonies**: Participating in certain rituals or ceremonies that are connected to the gravity stones or the mystical aspects of Praevaltus might enhance power levels.
- **Visions or Epiphanies**: Experiencing a profound vision or spiritual awakening could catalyze a jump in power, especially if it reveals new insights into the nature of their abilities.

### 5. **Environmental Factors**:

- **Proximity to Esderrus**: Being closer to Esderrus, the moon responsible for the gravity storms, might enhance the powers of Praevaltus. The gravitational pull and the associated energy could serve as a catalyst for power growth.
- **Gravity Storms**: Surviving or being directly involved in a gravity storm could trigger a significant boost in power, especially if the storm results in the formation of Gravitic Crystals.

### 6. **Genetic or Ancestral Factors**:

- **Bloodline**: Some individuals may have a stronger natural affinity for Praevaltus powers due to their lineage. If they descend from a line of powerful Praevaltus users, they may find it easier to progress.
- **Inherited Traits**: Certain genetic traits might predispose an individual to quicker or more potent power progression.

### 7. **Critical Events or Trials**:

- **Life-or-Death Situations**: Facing a critical event, such as a battle or life-threatening situation, might push an individual to surpass their current limits, unlocking new levels of power in the process.
- **Completion of a Significant Quest**: Successfully completing a major quest or mission that is tied to the gravity stones or the history of Praevaltus could result in a reward of greater power.

### 8. **Interaction with Other Powers**:

- **Synergy with Other Powers**: Collaborating with others who possess different powers from the Ascendant Triad (e.g., Corudus or Vecormus) might lead to unique interactions or synergies that boost Praevaltus powers.
- **Conflict with Opposing Forces**: Engaging in conflict or competition with individuals who wield opposing powers (like those of Corudus) could drive personal growth and lead to the unlocking of new levels of Praevaltus power.

This variety of factors ensures that progression in Praevaltus powers can be a dynamic and multifaceted experience, shaped by both internal development and external influences.

Certainly! Hereâ€™s a different approach to how someone might progress in their Praevaltus powers:

### 1. **Meditation and Internal Mastery**:

- **Level 1**: By engaging in deep meditation and self-reflection, the individual begins to unlock their latent Praevaltus abilities. This process helps them tap into their inner energy, allowing them to gain basic control over their powers.
- **Level 2**: As the individual continues to meditate, they learn to harmonize their powers with their emotions and thoughts. This synchronization enhances their abilities, making them more effective and easier to control.

### 2. **Gathering and Absorbing Energy**:

- **Level 3**: The individual learns to absorb energy from the environment, particularly from gravity stones or natural sources of gravity light. This absorption strengthens their powers, allowing them to use their abilities more frequently and with greater potency.
- **Level 4**: With practice, the individual becomes more adept at channeling this absorbed energy, allowing them to use their powers in more complex and creative ways.

### 3. **Facing Adversity and Overcoming Challenges**:

- **Level 5**: The individual encounters significant challenges, such as dangerous battles or difficult missions, that push their powers to the limit. These experiences force them to adapt and grow, unlocking new levels of power as they overcome these obstacles.
- **Level 6**: After surviving and learning from these trials, the individual gains a deeper understanding of their abilities. They can now use their powers with greater precision and effectiveness, even in high-stress situations.

### 4. **Connection to Ancestral or Mystical Sources**:

- **Level 7**: The individual experiences a profound connection to their ancestors or a mystical force tied to the Praevaltus powers. This connection grants them a significant boost in power, allowing them to achieve mastery over their abilities. At this level, their powers are at their peak, enabling them to perform extraordinary feats that were previously unimaginable.

This progression focuses on a combination of internal mastery, environmental interaction, and overcoming external challenges to reach the full potential of Praevaltus powers.
