### **1. Basic Mobility and Combat**

- **Enhanced Mobility:** Increase agility, allowing for faster movements, evasion, and jumping great distances.
- **Controlled Levitation:** Hover or float slightly above the ground, granting tactical advantages in movement or combat.
- **Gravity Adjustment for Speed:** Temporarily boost movement speed, improving quick reactions and rapid traversal.

### **2. Advanced Control and Exploration**

- **Advanced Levitation:** Levitate more precisely, allowing for controlled floating in mid-air or slow descents from high places.
- **Gravity Field Awareness:** Adjust personal gravity to move freely in challenging terrains, such as scaling walls or navigating unstable ground.

### **3. Mastery of Internal Gravity**

- **Gravitational Mastery:** Redirect internal gravity forces for advanced movement techniques, such as controlled flight or high-speed maneuvers.
- **Combat Agility:** Use gravity manipulation to execute rapid, unpredictable movements in combat, gaining a significant advantage in evading or striking opponents.

This progression covers enhanced personal movement, precise control over gravity for exploration and agility, and mastery of gravity for advanced combat techniques and creative applications.
