# Fausor
A Fausor is a creature with a stocky, robust build, standing about 5 feet tall. They possess a unique and striking feature: their eyes can be any color of the rainbow, making them visually diverse. Their bodies are sturdy, with a compact, muscular frame that reflects their strength and resilience. The Fausor's skin might have a natural toughness to it, perhaps with a slightly rough texture or a subtle glow that hints at their connection to the colorful spectrum of their eyes. Their overall appearance combines a sense of earthy solidity with a vibrant, almost ethereal quality due to their eye color.

# Umbraen
An Umbraen is characterized by a lean, wiry build, standing about 5.5 to 6 feet tall. Their physique is agile and flexible, well-suited for stealth and quick movements. Umbraen have a striking appearance, with monochromatic eyes that range from deep black to pale white. Their eyes are often intense and piercing, reflecting a depth of perception and awareness.

Their skin is typically a dark, shadowy hue, which helps them blend into darker environments. It might have a slightly reflective or matte finish, contributing to their elusive nature. Umbraen features are sharp and angular, with high cheekbones and a defined jawline, giving them a somewhat formidable or mysterious look.

In terms of clothing, Umbraen often wear practical, form-fitting garments that allow for ease of movement and concealment. Their attire is usually dark or muted, designed to enhance their ability to remain unnoticed in low-light conditions.

Umbraen are known for their abilities related to darkness and shadows, often excelling in tasks that require stealth, manipulation of light and dark, and heightened senses. They have a natural affinity for blending into their surroundings and moving silently, making them skilled in espionage and covert operations.

# Human
On Daivara, humans would have some unique characteristics adapted to the planet's specific conditions. Hereâ€™s how they might be described:
1. **Physical Build:** Humans on Daivara might have a sturdier build to handle the more intense environmental conditions, such as gravity fluctuations and storm activity. Their physiques could be more robust and resilient compared to those on other planets.
2. **Skin and Hair:** Due to the frequent gravity storms and varied atmospheric conditions, their skin might be slightly tougher or more resistant to environmental wear. Hair could be denser and more resistant to damage from the storms. Skin tones could vary, but might have adaptations such as a subtle sheen or reflective quality to protect against the harsh elements.
3. **Eyes:** Given the dramatic changes in light and gravitational effects, Daivaran humans might have larger or differently shaped eyes to improve vision under varying light conditions. Their eye colors might be more varied or adapted to enhance visibility in different environments.
4. **Clothing and Gear:** Clothing would likely be designed to handle the gravity storms, with features like reinforced materials or integrated shielding. Their garments might include elements that can adapt to sudden changes in gravity or provide additional protection against the environment.
5. **Adaptations:** Humans on Daivara could have developed additional physical or technological adaptations to cope with the planet's unique challenges. This might include enhancements to their sensory systems, such as better equilibrium or enhanced night vision, and specialized gear to manage the gravitational fluctuations.
Overall, humans on Daivara would be well-adapted to their planet's demanding conditions, blending resilience with specialized adaptations to thrive in their environment.
