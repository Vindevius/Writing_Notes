A tenimesor is a formidable and nearly immortal being created by Morthadim, possessing a unique and terrifying combination of powers. There are 17 tenimesors, each wielding three specific abilities that make them incredibly dangerous and difficult to kill.

A tenimesor is a skeletal being, both terrifying and unnatural in appearance, with pure black eyes and bone-white skin. They are reapers of darkness, wielding black scythes, and serve as agents of Lazera, the chief lazari (In reality it was Morthadim). Tenimesors possess immense power, including the ability to take and give life, and they are closely associated with death. Their eerie presence and dark power elicit fear and anxiety in those around them, making them formidable and unsettling entities. There are 17 tenimesors, and "Tenimesor" is a title rather than a name.

### Powers and Abilities:

1. **Decay Animals and Healing Factor (Corudus’s Virosa)**: This power allows a tenimesor to inflict decay on animals while also granting them an extraordinary healing factor. Their healing ability is so potent that even beheading them is not enough to kill them; they can regenerate and reform their bodies, making them nearly indestructible.
2. **Suffering (Corudus)**: This power enables a tenimesor to cause intense suffering to others. They can manipulate and amplify pain, both physical and emotional, which they often use to weaken and control their enemies.
3. **Virosa's Internal (Vecormus)**: This ability is the cornerstone of a tenimesor’s power. It allows them to take the life force from one being and transfer it to another, effectively binding the recipient to the tenimesor and the well of energy that sustains them. This process ties the individual to the tenimesor’s will, gradually transforming them into a more animalistic and manipulable state. The person becomes highly susceptible to influence from those who can control animals or manipulate minds, such as through the powers of Praevaltus’s Alter Animals or Corudus’s Plant Feelings. Once bound in this way, the tenimesor can access their victim's mind from anywhere, exerting control even over great distances.

### Weaknesses and Vulnerabilities:

While tenimesors are nearly impossible to kill due to their healing factor and ability to reform after even the most grievous injuries, they do have a crucial vulnerability: their connection to the well of energy. This connection is what sustains their life and grants them their regenerative abilities. To truly kill a tenimesor, one must sever this connection and completely destroy their body, ensuring that no part remains intact. Fire is particularly effective, as it can reduce their body to ashes, preventing any possibility of regeneration.

Another potential method of killing a tenimesor involves pushing them into a portal over a destructive force, such as a volcano, which can obliterate their entire form. Even in death, however, a tenimesor’s influence can persist through those they have corrupted unless their connection to the well of energy is severed.

### Control Over Corrupted Beings:

Tenimesors can corrupt others by transferring life force and binding them to the well of energy. Once corrupted, these individuals become susceptible to control by the tenimesor and are manipulated to align their thoughts and actions with their controller’s desires. Over time, the corrupted person becomes more animal-like, making them easier to control but still retaining a degree of free will. If the tenimesor who controls them is killed, the corrupted person is freed, but they remain vulnerable to manipulation by others with similar powers.

### Final Death:

To break the cycle of rebirth and allow a corrupted being to die permanently, a unique combination of powers is required: the healing power of Praevaltus and the affliction power of Corudus. Additionally, the person attempting to break the connection must be able to influence the mind of the corrupted being to sever the bond. Once the connection is broken, the next time the corrupted being dies, it will be their true death.

Tenimesors are thus a fearsome and almost unkillable force, embodying the essence of corruption, suffering, and relentless regeneration. Only by understanding and exploiting their few vulnerabilities can they be defeated and the cycle of their influence ended.



The tenimesor Daniel encountered is a skeletal figure cloaked in black, with pitch-black eyes that give it an unsettling presence. It wields a scythe, not the stylized weapon often depicted in stories, but an actual tool with a glassy obsidian blade and a dark grey handle, almost black. The creature embodies death, both in appearance and in its eerie, unnatural resilience. Even after being beheaded by Daniel, the tenimesor reanimates, standing up headless and striking back with its scythe, showcasing its terrifying ability to defy death and continue its grim task.

This passage describes a chilling scene where the tenimesor sacrifices Doron to make Daniel a puppet. The creature, without hesitation, beheads Doron, whose body disintegrates into dust. Daniel is left in stunned silence, unable to react as the tenimesor moves behind him. Expecting pain, Daniel turns to see the creature slam the scythe’s butt into his head, causing intense pain followed by an eerie, cold fire sensation across his skin. The pain overwhelms Daniel, and he screams before everything goes black.

The description effectively conveys the horror and power of the tenimesor, showcasing its ability to turn Daniel into a puppet through a mix of physical and supernatural torment.

Tenimesors possess a range of formidable abilities:

1. **Life Manipulation**: They can take life from others or bestow life, though the latter is rare and often used for specific, significant purposes.
2. **Fear Inducement**: Their eerie presence and dark aura can instill fear and anxiety in those around them, making them effective at unsettling and demoralizing opponents.
3. **Dark Energy Manipulation**: They can harness and manipulate dark energy, which can be used for various purposes, such as attacking, defending, or enhancing their scythes.
4. **Enhanced Strength and Speed**: Tenimesors have incredible physical strength and speed, making them formidable in combat and capable of executing their tasks with precision and efficiency.
5. **Ethereal Movement**: They can move through shadows or become intangible, allowing them to bypass physical barriers and appear suddenly where they are needed.
6. **Scythe Mastery**: Their scythes are not just weapons but extensions of their own dark power, able to cut through most materials and channel their dark energy for devastating effects.

### Creation
- **Sacrifice**: Individuals or powerful entities are sacrificed to channel the dark energies needed for creating a tenimesor.
- **Dark Energy Infusion**: The essence of the sacrificed beings is infused with dark energy from shadowy realms or corrupted sources, giving it the power required for transformation.
- **Skeletal Transformation**: The infused essence animates and transforms a skeletal frame into a tenimesor, resulting in its bone-white appearance and eerie aura.
- **Binding to Morthadim**: The newly created tenimesor is bound to Morthadim’s will through a final ritual, ensuring their loyalty and connection to him. This binding often involves an oath or magical contract.
- **Training and Conditioning**: After creation, tenimesors undergo training and conditioning to master their abilities and fulfill their roles. This training takes place in hidden sanctuaries or shadowy realms associated with Morthadim.
