- Praevecus
	- Head of state. The Praevecus is the figurehead of Aramus. He leads the meetings. The Arcelar must report to the Praevecus, but the Arcelar has more power.
- Arcelar
	- Head of government. The Arcelar is over the military and the judiciary system. He is the supreme judge and general of Aramus. With the passing of Arcelar Thorn’s policy, he now has singular control of the military in crisis. He has the ability to declare martial law.
- Nobility
	- The nobility of Aramus controls the senate. The people vote for them, but the only people to attain office tend to be the nobility. Three or seven houses (depending on the province, seven have three and seven have seven. The capital has three.) from each province are typically elected. If someone outside of a noble house were elected to the Senate, which hasn’t happened in centuries, they would become lesser nobility.
