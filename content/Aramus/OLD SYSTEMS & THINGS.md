- House of Prophecy (Dovus Vaicinii)
	- Dreams (Dovulus Somii):
		- Powers: Telepathy is common. They are prone to have strange dreams, but not to the extent of Seers. They are very talented at seeing things differently than others. This allows them to be very good at interpreting the visions and dreams that come to others. They can also sense when someone is lying. Some have precognition or clairvoyance.
	- Seers (Dovulus Vistis):
		- Powers: Telepathy is common. They are prone to Visions of both future, present, and past. They tend to speak things that make no sense, but have a deeper meaning to them at seemingly random times. They can sense when someone is untruthful. Some have precognition or clairvoyance. The High Seer has an increased form of these abilities. They tend to have longevity.


- House of Wisdom (Dovus Saupientia)
	- Knowledge (Dovulus Scientae): 
		- Powers: Telepathy is fairly common, not as common as Inteligentae. Most have photographic memories. When they learn something they are not likely to forget it. They are great teachers and great tacticians when planning strategies. Others can find them arrogant.
	- Intelligence (Dovulus Inteligentae): 
		- Powers: Telepathy is common. They are highly intelligent but tend to overthink things. They can also think they can do everything on their own and not look for help when needed. They tend to have anxiety or depression because of this. They may also have visions or dreams.
	- Justice (Dovulus Iustiae):
		- Powers: Telepathy is uncommon. They can be clairvoyant or psychic. They see things others don’t, including little details others would miss. This makes them great at keeping the peace and seeing through people's lies. They could be considered detectives.

- House of Elements (Dovus Elemetōrum)
	- Storms (Dovulus Tempastatis):
		- Powers: Conjure lightning from the air around them. They can control the wind and create mini storms. The more powerful ones can create massive storms. Water is also under their control. Some can even create hail or spikes of ice. Others can boil water.
	- Earthquakes (Dovulus Tarraemoti):
		- Powers: They can shake the ground powerfully. Some can create fissures within the ground. The more powerful ones or others combined could create volcanic eruptions under the right conditions.
	- Magic (Dovulus Magiae):
		- Conjures all sorts of magic. Most diverse of the House of Elements. They cannot, however, do any of the things the others can. They are limited to more magical abilities.
		- Powers: They can create illusions to confuse the enemy, making it seem like there are more people than there really are. They can also create almost living creatures out of the material around them. This is more challenging and takes both concentration and time to do. They typically team up with the House of Blacksmiths to create life-like automatons for practice. Using this same magic, they can create objects that can shapeshift them into other creatures when worn. They typically keep those to a minimum due to the prolonged consequences. Telepathy is common. They can also create magical items out of what the Blacksmiths make. They can also dispel malefic (evil spirits). This is a complicated process that involves deep meditation. 

- House of War (Dovus Belei)
	- Combat (Dovulus Dimacadionis):
		- Powers: They have increased strength, are typically brave, and disciplined. They can be seen as arrogant or stubborn, even with their discipline. 
	- Archery (Dovulus Sagiationis):
		- Powers: They are agile and light on their feet. They have improved dexterity and strength. They share most of their qualities with the House of Combat.
	- Blacksmiths (Dovulus Ferarii):
		- Powers: They have a creative mind and are great at tinkering with mechanical things. Some are naturally resistant to fire. They create the shells of automaton so that the House of Magic can imbue them with their power.

- House of Healing (Dovus Medantis)
	- Health (Dovulus Salootis):
		- They’re doctors. They have an extraordinary power to mend and heal, which is typically accompanied by a bright white light. They can heal broken bones and minor puncture wounds very quickly. Typically within a week they are healed enough to move freely. Major wounds, such as being stabbed with a sword, take much more energy to heal. These wounds take much longer to heal fully. It takes multiple sessions of healing over this process. Venom is another matter. Purifying it out of the system takes a lot of energy. They are more precise at healing than medics are.
	- Medics (Dovulus Medici):
		- They have most of the abilities of the doctors, but have a stronger proficiency with stabilizing those with major wounds. They can stabilize someone in the middle of a battlefield until they’re able to be moved to a place they can be worked on. Medics are more about speed and stabilizing than fully healing.
	- The Dead (Dovulus Morti):
		- Probably the most mysterious of all the houses. Some consider them to be necromancers. Some even compare them to the tenimesors. They are able to summon and commune with the dead, if they are willing. They can also bring back others from the dead if it hasn’t been more than a few hours since they’re death. The process to do so is complicated and does not always work. Most of the time it doesn’t. It’s all up to the fates.

- House of Agriculture (Dovus Agericulura)
	- Harvest (Dovulus Massis):
		- They have power over plants, mostly through the use of auloi. They normally tend to the fields although their power over plants can come in handy on the battlefield. Some in this house are changed (the capri) so that when they die they turn into flowers or other plants. Chris is an example of this. Capri were once human, but somehow, they were changed into beasts. Like werewolves, but more pure.
	- Livestock (Dovulus Vivacoupiae):
		- They have power over animals, using auloi, they can command animals similar to how plants are controlled. Some in Agriculture, like Chris, have power over both plants and animals.

- House of Travel (Dovus Perinationis)
	- Transport (Dovulus Vecdurae):
		- They have many abilities that other Houses have, but they are agile and have a keen sense of direction. They can be trackers.
	- Messengers (Dovulus Viatoris):
		- They are very agile and quick. They can be very quiet when they want to. Most of the time, they are very talkative though. They also process many abilities that other Houses possess.
	- Portals (Dovulus Musicae):
		- They are very musically talented and know how to create instrumental weapons. Most of their weapons are good at stunning, not at killing. They provide entertainment for the fort. They have many other abilities that other Houses possess.
