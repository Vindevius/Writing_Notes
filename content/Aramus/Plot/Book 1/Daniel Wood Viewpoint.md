Daniel barely dodged the flaming chunk of wood that fell from above. This night was getting better and better. Their whole stunt to take out that stupid snake? Yeah, that failed. Totally and completely. Not only did they fail to kill that oversized serpent, but they set the whole forest on fire.  
Daniel jumped over another burning log. The fire singed a few of the hairs on his arm. Where did that gorcin go? The tall one that could control fire? He was just behind Daniel a second ago. Xurex was the reason Daniel was in his current predicament. It was almost like Xurex singled him out from the group. He did throw that wall of fire between Daniel and the others. There wasn't time to try to get around that wall of fire. Daniel needed to find another way out of this mess.  
What was that shadow in the fire? Daniel took out his sword. He lost his spear in the chaos. He glanced from side to side. The shadow had vanished. A flaming branch fell behind him. Daniel dived to the side. Blast! I need to get out of here!  
Daniel stood up to look into the eyes of death. A black-robed creature stood in front of him. The thing was a skeleton with pitch-black eyes. It held a scythe. Not the fantastical kind that is typically associated with death, but the actual tool. The one that is held sideways and used to cut grass or wheat. The scythe’s blade looked to be made out of glassy obsidian. Its handle was painted a dark grey. It was almost black but not quite.  
Daniel froze. He had never seen anything like this creature before. Daniel recovered quickly. His sword beheaded the creature in one swift motion. It crumpled to the dirt. Its skeletal head rolled away until it hit a tree.  
Daniel took a deep breath. He didn't scare easily, but that thing was unnatural. It shouldn't exist. Daniel turned to leave back through the burning forest. Movement near the skeleton caught his eye.  
  
Five hairy little creatures appeared out of the woodwork. Maluculi. They pounced. He managed to slice through one, but the others managed to tackle him to the ground. He thrashed violently to get them off him. He managed to shove them off enough to get to one knee.  
  
From the corner of his eye, he saw the headless creature standing up, scythe in hand. In one swift motion, it slammed the scythe’s handle into Daniel’s head. His helmet took most of the blow, but it still threw him back to the ground. Daniel glanced up just in time to be nailed in the face by the handle of the scythe. Everything went black.  
  
Daniel awoke chained to an obsidian block. Someone else was chained alongside him. “Daniel? They got you too?”  
Daniel shook himself out of his stupor. “Doron? Why didn't they kill us?”  
“I don't know, but that creature caught me off guard. I've never seen anything like it.”  
“The skeleton?”  
“Yeah.”  
“It put me off balance too.”  
  
The creature walked into the room. Without a word, it raised its scythe and beheaded Doron. His head fell to the ground. Daniel was speechless. The stories always had the characters scream when something like this happened. But Daniel found that he couldn't even breathe. Screaming no was out of the question.  
Doron’s body did something strange. It completely disintegrated into dust. It ended just as abruptly as it began. The creature wordlessly walked behind Daniel.  
Daniel prepared for a sharp pain, but it didn't come. He glanced behind him. The creature stood silently. As he turned, the creature slammed the butt of its scythe into his head. The side of his head smacked into the obsidian block. Amidst the pain in his head, he felt a sharp pain in his side.  
Was the creature just waiting for him to... Wait. Where did the pain go? Even his head wasn't pulsing anymore from the head trauma. It only lasted a moment, then Daniel’s skin turned into cold fire. It was like his entire skin was ripped apart and then frozen back together This time, Daniel did scream. This pain was too much. Everything went black once again.  
  
Daniel woke up tied to a post outside a large command tent.  
  
  
“The scythe was laced with a painful toxin we use to torture our captives. Speak!”  
  
He uses his armor to escape. By expanding it, it cuts through his chains.
