Alex on the other hand, swept towards Emily, speaking to her mind, Emily, how are you doing this fine morning?  
Alex? Emily replied in surprise. You freaked me out for a second there. I almost forgot that we could communicate telepathically.  
I forget too sometimes. We don’t use it enough to always remember we have it. Alex agreed. So, are you going to answer my question?  
Oh, of course. Emily stuttered. I’m doing well, even with this whole predicament we have going on. How are you?  
I’m great, just contemplating the upcoming events. Alex replied.  
What if we don’t make it? Emily asked. I know that the chances are slim that we won’t make it, but that still doesn’t change the possibility.  
Emily, trust me, we’re going to make it. Alex assured.  
Alex, just forget the odds for a second. Emily said. Just tell me, if I don’t make it, who will miss me? Who won’t forget me after a few years? Who will remember me twenty years in the future? What difference have I made to have people remember me?  
Alex stared gently into Emily’s eyes as he said out loud, “I will. I don’t know about anyone else Emily, but I can tell you this much, I would miss you.” Emily stared back into his eyes as he continued, “It doesn’t matter what others think of you Emily, all you need to know is that you are loved. You might be forgotten by the world, but to those that actually matter you will never be forgotten, and that’s what counts. That and that your thoughts toward yourself are in loving yourself, not in conforming to anyone else’s standards.”  
“Thank you, Alex,” Emily said as she embraced him. “Gradia Alex, that means the world to me.”
