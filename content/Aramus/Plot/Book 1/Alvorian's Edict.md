A policy that will give the Arcelar more power over the nation’s military.  
  
The policy is not about giving the Arcelar more power. It’s about strengthening the structure of the military to help unify them in purpose.  
  
It gives the Arcelar too much power over the military. It’s unconstitutional.  
  
Tensions are high with Sanithon and Malshion. Both of which have constantly waged war with Aramus over the millenia. With Leazdern to the north constantly threatening war, Acknidorn interrupting trade with Vesolmex, and Maesefloria contesting various islands, it’s no wonder the people want these changes.  
  
The Arcelar cannot have that much power. It needs to be divided. I propose you amend your proposition to divide the power between different offices like it always has been. Perhaps appoint someone for each of the fourteen provinces.  
  
It will allow Leazdern control over Aramus’s military through the Arcelar.  
  
It makes something previously illegal legal  
  
It has to do with the secret army.  
  
It gives the Arcelar too much power over the military. It is not constitutional. Request amending the proposition to divide the power between different offices like it always has been. Appoint someone for each of the fourteen provinces.  
  
Further divide the power instead of consolidating it? The whole purpose of this policy is to protect Aramus. The people do not feel secure anymore. Tensions are rising on all sides. Is this what you want for Aramus? For the people to fear each day of their lives?  
  
We must divide the power or risk taking away the freedom of the people. The people of Cardellia are well aware of the threat of Leazdern and Sanithon. We border both of them!  
  
By giving the Arcelar this power, we allow him to make the decisions in times of stress that could save countless lives!
