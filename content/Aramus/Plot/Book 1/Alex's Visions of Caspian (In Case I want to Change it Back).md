Shatterridge:  
  
Alex was on top of a wall, looking down over a walled-in field. Only, he wasn’t looking through his own eyes. He had no control over this body, not even his own thoughts. He didn’t feel any pain in his leg anymore. In fact, he felt much better. These things registered without him having to think of any of it. He was no longer in his body. This body belonged to someone named Caspian.  
  
Alex couldn’t tell what was on the parchment. Before he could find out, Caspian blinked, and Alex saw no more.  
  
The Council:  
  
Alex opened the door to a large assembly hall. He was looking through the eyes of Caspian again. He again had no control over his thoughts or actions.  
  
Alex caught a glimpse of a drawing of some fortifications. From the small glimpse he gathered, it looked eerily similar to Pridurlas’ outer wall.  
  
Training:  
  
He thought about the dream he just had. What was the Chancellor up to? It sounded like he made a decision that he regretted. Alex decided to put it to the side for now.  
  
Tenimesor:  
  
Alex still wasn’t used to these visions he’d been having. Each one had left him wondering about whatever was amiss with the Chancellor. He still hadn’t told anyone about them. Not even Emily.  
  
Reunion:  
  
Alex woke to a drenched shirt. The image of the Tenimesor, the skull, and those black eyes, burned into his brain. He breathed heavily for a moment, trying to get the picture out of his head. What did I just see? He thought to himself. That can’t have been real! It must have really been a nightmare this time. That doesn’t make sense, though. Before these dreams, or visions, or whatever you wanted to call them, I had never seen the Chancellor or anyone at Shatter Ridge. I have never gone much more south than where I am now!  
  
The Message:  
  
“Now, one more thing. Why haven’t you told anyone about your visions of Chancellor Thorn?”  
Alex must have looked surprised, because Cyril chuckled and said, “I thought you’d be used to me knowing things by now. I am the Seer after all. So, are you going to answer my question?”  
Alex shook away the surprise and said, “I don’t know. I couldn’t figure out why I was having those visions. They do concern me though.”  
“Any vision should concern you,” Cyril said, his tone suddenly turning serious. “Especially one given so blatantly by the Almighty to warn you. I will talk to Ulysses about it and we will look into it. Expect us to contact you later about it.”  
“Okay, I will.”  
  
The Flames of the Forest:  
  
Alex remembered his last vision of the Chancellor. The Chancellor had known. Did he tell them?  
  
The Chancellor:  
  
“Chancellor?” Alex asked. He hesitated a moment. Should I even let this man in? He thought. After a brief internal debate, he said, “Right this way.”  
  
Like he doesn’t already know, he added to himself.  
  
No thanks to you, he thought.  
  
For a traitor, he sure does know how to charm people.  
  
“Oh, he’s a threat. I know that for sure.” Alex said. I’m sure you know all about him.  
  
Has he even met their leader yet? Judging on how he reacted to the Tenimesor, I guess not, Alex thought to himself.  
  
As soon as Alex closed the door and sat down, he closed his eyes. If I fall asleep, maybe I can connect with the Chancellor like before. He thought to himself. I need to know how honest he is being.  
Alex was surprised how quickly he drifted off. Within a minute, he was asleep. The past few days had really taken it out of him. The next thing he knew, he was looking back at Ulysses.  
“He’s dead?” He heard himself say. He was back in the Chancellor’s body. He was able to think for himself this time. I guess after all these visions I’d figure out how to think for myself during them.  
“Yes,” Ulysses said somberly. “He was killed during the surprise attack on the Aurusoren.”  
“What? How?” The Chancellor almost screamed. Alex sensed a tear roll down the side of Caspian’s face. Alex realized where he heard Axel’s name before. Caspian’s heart sank deep into a dark ocean. A strange numbness emanated from around it. Alex knew this feeling well.  
“Those who witnessed it said a cloaked figure with a scythe killed him shortly after the flames erupted, along with another near him,” Ulysses said.  
“NO!”  
Alex bolted up. It took him a moment to realize that the Chancellor had screamed loud enough to wake him up from the other side of the door. Why was the Chancellor so upset when he found out how his son died? I mean, I understand how he feels, but that last moment when he screamed... Alex thought to himself. The Chancellor wasn’t just feeling despair. He was furious. He felt betrayed.  
“Alex.”  
Alex shook himself back to focus. He had been so distracted that he hadn’t realized the door opened. Ulysses was staring at him.  
“Yes, sir?”  
“Come in here,” Ulysses said. “I have a question for you.”  
“Okay.”  
Alex wasn’t sure if he should be scared or not. After a moment of hesitation, he walked into the office. The Chancellor was now sitting in a chair, his head between his knees. His whole body was shaking. Alex was about to say something when Ulysses’ voice sounded in his head. What did you feel?  
What? Alex thought back.  
I know what you just did, he said, staring at him. The concern in his eyes were evident. Cyril and I have discussed your previous visions concerning the Chancellor. I know you just connected again.  
How could you tell? Alex asked.  
It’s irrelevant, but I felt your presence in the Chancellor, he said. Now, can we trust the Chancellor?  
I don’t know, sir, he started. I don’t know what he is contemplating right now, but when you mentioned how his son died something changed in him.  
How so?  
Well, he was mourning the loss of his son already, but when you mentioned the cloaked figure with a scythe he felt betrayed.  
Betrayed?  
Yes. He was furious. The brief moment I felt before his scream woke me up he felt so betrayed. Like someone had done something even worse than death to his son, Alex said. What do you think that means, sir?  
I do not know. This is the first time I have known of these cloaked figures.  
Did Cyril show you my vision of the Chancellor meeting one of those cloaked figures?  
Yes. It called itself a Tenimesor.  
What does that name mean?  
The literal translation is dark reaper or reaper of the darkness. It could also be translated of reaper from the darkness.  
This Tenimesor, what do you think it is? Alex asked.  
I do not know, but perhaps the Chancellor could enlighten us, Ulysses said. You have done enough, Alex. Go back to what you were doing. I can handle it from here.  
Okay.
