Theren-Book 1
	Averian and Theren were hurtling through the burning forest, searching desperately for a way out of the flames and back to Winterfall Watch, but they found none. Theren sniffed the air. “There’s still a few gorcins around here, I bet one of them is Xurex, but I can’t tell where with this smoke around us.”
	“We just need to focus on finding a way out, we can’t be entirely encircled by fire,” Averian said, exasperated from their search.
	“There!” Theren shouted pointing at the only darkened area left of the forest, a small clearing the size of a large doorway. It was unscathed by the flames around them.
	They both ran for the safety of the gap in the fire. A dark figure emerged from the shadow as they sped towards the hole. His ash skin shone against the orange light. In his hands, he hefted a long steel sword. Averian’s gut twisted inside him. His heart beat faster. He had a strange feeling he had seen this before.
	Xurex swung his sword without hesitation towards Theren, who was closest to him. Theren recoiled away, almost losing his balance. Xurex pressed forward, hoisting his sword to swing again. Averian stood, his feet frozen to the ground. Theren held up his sword to block Xurex’s swing. Xurex’s greatsword clashed against Theren's sword. Theren staggered back. Averian shook his head and reached for his bow.  With a thrust, Xurex heaved his greatsword towards Theren. Averian strung his bow and notched an arrow. Theren's whole body shook. Averian drew in a sharp breath as he watched a long blade of steel recede from his best friend. Theren fell to the ground, limp. Xurex’s steel blade was stained by Theren's scarlet blood.
	Averian froze, stunned at the almost lifeless corpse of his friend lying on the ground. A wave of rage like the fury of a storm-tossed sea descended over Averian. He let loose his arrow, which found itself implanted in Xurex’s right shoulder. The tall gorcin began to laugh quietly. He cleaned his blade and raised his sword to attack Averian. Averian, fueled by fire, quickly parried the attack with his dagger. He then kicked Xurex in the gut. In one smooth action, he slit Xurex’s throat. Xurex crumpled to the ground. After a brief struggle to breathe, he lay motionless. Averian could hear as he faded to nothing, leaving Averian alone with Theren's body. The wind took the gorcin away. Xurex was granted the ability to reform. He’d be back. They had walked right into his trap, and Theren was paying for it. 
	Averian quickly sank to his knees, lifting Theren into his arms. Theren only had the strength to look up at Averian, unable to move his body. Averian asked him, his voice shaking, “I can’t lose you too, Theren.”
	“Averian, you will get through this.”
	“I don’t want to. I’m not strong enough to go through this.”
	“It’s not about when you are strong. It’s about when you are weak. That’s when it truly matters. That defines a man.”
	“You can come back right? Like the other monsters? Right, Theren?” He said, even though he knew the answer.
	“No,” Theren breathed out, “capri aren’t like other monsters. We can die. We end up turning into plants shortly after we die. I hope I become a beautiful flower.”
	Averian, accepting the inevitable, said with tears flowing from his eyes, “I hope you do too. I’m going to miss you, Theren.”
	“You won’t have to. I’ll always be with you, just as a flower. That might be a plus for you, you won’t have to hear me talk anymore or tell any of my jokes.”
	“As much as I hated your jokes, I’m going to miss them.”
	“Ha, that’s new. I must be dreaming then.” Theren began to cough, losing the energy he had left. “Tell my wife I love her. Goodbye, Averian.”
	“Theren, no.” But it was too late. Theren's body finally fell limp, his eyes glazed over, and he slowly faded away, leaving in his stead a bright golden lily gleaming in the firelight. He had his wish; he was a beautiful flower. Yellow lilies represented gaiety, the quality of being lighthearted or cheerful. It defined Theren perfectly.
	Tears fell from Averian’s eyes as he slowly scooped up the flower. He held it in his hands for a moment before he carefully placed it in a tin can and into his backpack. For a moment, he knelt there in his sorrow. But soon, rage replaced the sorrow in Averian’s mind.
	He stood up, looking forward through the gap, and walked through it. Averian wasn’t satisfied. The death of Xurex did nothing to solve his problem; the death of his closest friend. Averian rampaged out of the burnt woods, cutting down any gorcin that crossed his path.
	Eventually, he settled down and somberly trudged in the dark to Winterfall Watch, arriving only to collapse at its gates, physically and mentally exhausted. The sun was just beginning to rise. Averian broke down right there across from the gate. He collapsed at the edge of the trench, crying his heart out, not caring if anyone saw him. Theren, one of the only people who understood him, was gone. Theren was dead, and there was nothing he could do about it. 
Toveril-Book 1
	Toveril faced Aveslio, sticking his trident out towards the beast, dodging every move it made. That's when it happened. Lazera slunk out from the shadows, a long sword in her hands. She positioned herself behind him. Averian yelled, “Toveril, look out!”
	But it was too late, as he whirled around Lazera stuck her blade straight through his heart, the sword appearing on the other side of his body. A look of surprise passed over his face as he dropped his trident. Lazera pulled her sword out of Toveril as he crumpled to the ground, motionless. Lazera glared at Averian, an evil smirk creeping over her face. “Averian!” She called. “I told you I wanted to make you suffer, now how about I find that lovely girl you were oh so fond of and do the same to her?” Lazera smirked as she cleaned her blade.
	Averian couldn't help his emotions, it was a mixture of sadness and rage, both fighting for control of his actions. The rage won. He charged at her and pole-vaulted over multiple monsters, slicing them in half. He cut down all in his path, raging towards Lazera, who calmly hopped onto Aveslio's back and galloped away.
Crasio-Book 2
	A bright blue light suddenly pulsed out of Nerissa and Vermich, carving into the glacier in front of the monsters. Almost immediately, the ice melted into water and burst from the glacier, knocking over the nearby monsters. The water then turned around, sucking the monsters into the ravine that had formed. Everyone quickly stabbed into the ground, holding on for dear life as the monsters flew past them.
	Suddenly, a gorcin rushed past and grabbed hold of Crasio, taking him with it. Averian only had enough time to snag Crasio's hand before he, too, was dragged along, disappearing into the rush of water. Averian dragged his dagger along the glacier, but they soon went over the edge. Their only support was Averian’s dagger carved into the side of the glacier.
	The water soon had all passed them, leaving them hanging there, ten feet from the top of the ravine. Faces appeared over the ledge, trying to find a way to save them, but the gorcin still had a hold on Crasio’s leg, pulling them slowly down the cliff. Averian struggled to hold his grip on both Crasio and the dagger that held them from falling. Averian’s burden was lessened as Crasio lessened his own gravity. This was short lived, as the gorcin began to increase in weight. The gorcin started to climb Crasio to get to the top of the ravine. Crasio screamed in pain as blood began to rush out of his side where the gorcin had grabbed him. His grip began to loosen as he gazed up at Averian, pain evident on his face, and squeezed out, “I’m sorry.”
	Averian looked back at him as Crasio let go and slipped from his grasp, falling into the abyss below, taking the gorcin with him. Averian yelled into the ravine, “Crasio!”
	Vermich jumped off the side of the cliff above and soared past Averian. Averian watched as they fell. Crasio reached out for Vermich’s outstretched hand. Then Crasio and the gorcin hit the ground with a thud. Crasio’s broken body lay motionless on the ground, dust from the monsters blowing past him and shattered bones all around him. Vermich stumbled to the ground beside him. The whole experience was over in a matter of seconds.
	Almedin flew down to Averian and grabbed hold of him. Averian ripped his dagger free and allowed Almedin to guide him up the cliff face. Averian glanced back down the ravine where Vermich cradled Crasio in his arms. “Rian, get us down there,” Sam said.
	Riandan opened a portal and they walked through it. Almedin placed his hand on Vermich’s shoulder.
	“I wasn’t fast enough,” Vermich said, tears streaming down his face. “I was so close.”
	Vermich looked at Nadaria, pleading with his eyes. “There’s nothing I can do. I can’t bring him back.”
Vermich-Book 3
	As soon as the floor collapsed and fell into the abyss beneath, the monsters vanished with it. Few monsters survived the ambush, and they were swiftly taken care of, but a pack of maluculi ruined the moment. The maluculi tackled Vermich and began to maul him. Averian rushed toward him. A blast of air sent the maluculi flying off of Vermich. Averian stumbled to the ground due to the force. As he stood up, Vermich slumped to the ground. The ground around Vermich opened into a massive fissure, which Vermich fell in. Averian leapt for Vermich and managed to snag Vermich's hand over the edge. Averian clung to Vermich’s hand as the fissure expanded to hasten their demise.
	Vermich glanced towards Averian, fear evident on his face. “Averian, I'm sorry, but only one of us is making it out of here, and it’s not going to be me.”
	“Vermich, you don't know that!” Averian struggled out, straining to hold on. “We can both make it!”
	“I’m sorry Averian, they need you too much.” Vermich disagreed. “I don’t have any more energy. It’s my time.”
	Averian saddened, tears appearing in his eyes. Suddenly, the floor collapsed again, threatening to send both of them into the abyss. Satilius weaved through the mayhem batting away any maluculi that came close. Averian began to feel Vermich’s hand loosen from his grip. “I can’t hold on any longer.”
	Averian lamented, “Say hi to Crasio for me.”
	“I will. I promise you that. Goodbye, Averian.”
	“Goodbye, Vermich.”
	Averian felt Vermich’s grip loosen and let go as he slipped out of Averian’s hand. Vermich fell and vanished into the darkness below, he didn’t make another sound. Thirty seconds later, Averian was on Satilius’s back.
Colidan-Book 4
	As Averian looked toward Colidan and Veridex, Veridex pulled his sword out and stabbed Colidan in the gut. Colidan, in surprise, pulled his sword out and was able to cut Veridex's face as he fell to the ground. Veridex proceeded to take off, running down the hill. Sam, Marcus, and Wraize chased him as he ran away, and Averian ran towards Colidan lying on the ground. As he knelt beside him, Colidan stammered, “Next time you see Veridex, will you kill him for me?”
	“Yes, Colidan,” He replied. “I'll do that for you.”
	“And Averian,” He started, blood appearing on his lips. “Will you win this war for me?”
	“Yes, Colidan, I will even if I die trying, and I have no doubt in my mind that if I do die trying, someone else here will win for both of us,” Averian declared.
	“And Averian,” Colidan began. “Will you take care of my potato for me?”
	“Yes, Colidan, I'll definitely take care of your potato,” Averian responded tearfully.
	“Thank you, Averian. Thanks for everything. You've been one of the best leaders this fort has ever had. Now go, win us that war! Vala, Averian,” he croaked with his last breath. In the next moment, Colidan was gone. All that was left was the spirit he left and his final words clinging to the air. At that moment, Averian decided they needed to find the traitor Veridex and bring him to justice, and to win this war, for Colidan and all those who had lost their lives because of it.
Veridex-Book 4
	Killed after killing Colidan by Sam. His final words are, in response to Averian and Wraize: “I never wanted to do it. I’ve been dead for a while now. Years even. Ever since the ambush at Winterfall.” He then fades to nothing as his skeleton falls to the ground. It is from Averian’s point of view

I’m just catching up now. Hopefully, I can apologize to Colidan. I never wanted to kill him. I die as me.” His eyes lose their light. It is from his point of view
Arcelar Thorn and Averian Novenis-Book 4
	Morthadim appeared from amidst the army, towering over almost everything. He dragged a long steel blade by his side. His black cloak still covered his entire body, shrouding his face in darkness. He didn’t wear any armor, but he also didn’t need to. No one could touch him. He calmly walked out of the main gate, the entire army of Nindurlas waiting for him.
	Arcelar Thorn stepped out from among the crowd, sword in hand. He held his shield up, preparing for the worst. Without a word, Morthadim raised his sword and let it bounce off the Arcelar’s shield. The Arcelar staggered backward but quickly steadied himself. He charged forward, sword raised. Their swords clashed, and sparks flew from the colliding steel. Thorn dodged and weaved around Morthadim, not leaving the giant a second to be on the offensive.
	Then in an instant, everything changed. Morthadim swung his sword around and again clashed it against the Arcelar’s, expelling it from his hand. The Arcelar fell to the ground, stunned. Before anything else could happen, Morthadim pierced his sword into the fallen hero and twisted it. The Arcelar grimaced in pain before his body went limp. Morthadim pulled his sword from the lifeless corpse that was once the Arcelar of Aramuania, hefting it back above his waist.
	Averian stepped out from among the crowd, bow aimed directly at the creature in front of him. He took one step forward and shouted, “This nonsense has gone on for far too long Morthadim. Today, your army falls! Defenders of Aramuania, prove your worth! Take down the enemy once and for all! Charge!”
	With those words, the army of Pridurlas charged, locking into combat with the army of Death. Averian released his arrow. Morthadim easily deflected it. Morthadim took a few short steps and brought his scythe-sword down on Averian. Averian rolled to the side, bow still in hand. Right as he turned, notched another arrow, and swung his bow towards Morthadim, a boot kicked him in the side. Averian lost his grip on his bow as he flew to one side. Morthadim was on top of him. He rolled away from his next strike and managed to get to his feet. He expanded his shield. He knew Morthadim’s boot just bruised his ribs.
	Morthadim stood between him and his bow. Averian quickly processed his surroundings. The lifeless body of Arcelar Thorn lay to one side. The Arcelar’s sword was just off to his side. Averian lunged for it. He picked it up and turned to face Morthadim. Morthadim slowly walked towards Averian. They locked eyes, preparing to fight. Averian held his shield out in front of him, preparing to swing with his sword arm. He swung. His sword clashed against Morthadim’s blade. They became heated into an intense duel, neither one letting off their guard. Neither risked any move that could leave them open.
	Morthadim hefted his scythe-sword into Averian's shield, sending him backwards. He quickly recovered, clashing his sword once again with Morthadim's blade. He parried a lunge made by Morthadim. (insert something to cause Averian's shield to collapse) Averian, with both hands, swung his sword. Their swords locked together. Averian looked at his sword, he felt it starting to bend. He thought to himself, If I don't get out of this, my blade will break.
	Immediately, Averian spun away as Morthadim lunged forward. Averian swept his sword across Morthadim's side, to which Morthadim responded by heaving his sword right towards Averian. Averian rolled away, jumping to his feet to face Morthadim once more. Pain surged through his bruised ribs.  He ignored them and charged. As Morthadim swung at him, he slid underneath him. He slashed Morthadim’s left leg and expanded his shield, which he swung into the back of Morthadim’s right knee. Morthadim fell flat on his face but straightaway rose again. He kicked Averian in the face with his good leg, which sent him to the ground. Morthadim raised his scythe-sword to end him, but Averian rolled out of the way just in time and back on his feet.
	Morthadim became even more aggressive. Averian could hardly keep up, dodging and weaving around him. Then, Morthadim heaved his scythe sword again at Averian, who blocked it. They were once again in a sword lock. Before Averian had time to do anything, Morthadim headbutted him, knocking him back a couple of steps. Before Averian could recover, Morthadim had plunged his scythe into his stomach.
	Averian gasped and looked down at the blade that was in him. He glanced at Morthadim, who had an evil grin on his stone gray face. Morthadim quickly pulled his sword out of Averian's gut as Averian sunk to his knees. Morthadim raised his sword again to end him but stopped when a single arrow flew towards him. He easily deflected it, but his attention was now to the side.
	Averian painfully glanced over to see Emilia, Averian’s bow in hand, notching another arrow. “Archers to the ready!” she yelled. “Aim! Fire!”
	With that, she let her arrow fly, and a hundred more came. All aimed well past Averian but close to Morthadim. Morthadim didn’t hesitate before he limped away into his army. He disappeared into the masses, but the monsters around him were massacred. Morthadim escaped back through the gate.
	Averian could hardly process this. He watched as Emilia rushed to his side. He fell into her loving arms once more. Demetria came rushing in as well, immediately working to save his life. A white glow emanated from her hands.
	Averian just laid there, staring into Emilia's beautiful sapphire eyes, realizing that they may be the last thing he sees. For a short moment, there was silence. He saw tears form in those beautiful sapphire eyes and start to fall. He opened his mouth to speak.
	“Emilia, I need you to press forward. I need you to be strong,” he coughed.
	“Averian,” she muttered, her eyes wet. “I need you to stay.”
	“I don't think that’s my choice,” he croaked. “Don’t cry.”
	“Don’t go. Stay with me,” she pleaded, tears flowing down her cheeks. Averian could feel tears of his own form and do the same. “I need you.”
	“You're beautiful, Emilia. I love you so much.”
	“I love you too. I love you more than anything. So please, don’t go. Oh Almighty above!” she sobbed.
	“It’s okay. It’s all going to be okay,” he choked out. He paused for a moment. He felt so cold. Almost all energy had left him. Warm blood soaked through his shirt. He gazed at Emilia’s wonderful sapphire eyes once more, tears streaming out of them. His vision began to blur. He didn’t have much time. “Emilia, I love you.”
	“Averian.”
	“Goodbye, Emilia,” he struggled out, gasping for one more breath. “I love you.”
	“Averian, no!” she cried, tears gushing from her sapphire eyes.
	Then with one last breath, his vision turned to darkness, and he faded away into eternity.

In an instant, Morthadim plunged his scythe into the Vistes’s chest. Sirilan glanced at Averian and sputtered, “Stay faithful. The Almighty will provide.” With one final gasp, the Vistes’s eyes rolled back into his head, and Morthadim let him slide off his scythe to the floor. “So much for the Almighty,” Morthadim sneered. “Rot in Torbanum, you filthy monster!” Averian screamed as he rushed Morthadim.
Riandan & Nerissa-Book 7
	It happens shortly after Emilia, Riandan, and Nerissa appear to help Averian at the top of the Tower of Prophecy. Riandan is picked up by the throat by Morthadim and stabbed. His body is flung off to the side. Nerissa yells, No! Sprints at Morthadim and is hit in the head with the butt of his sword. Averian yells Nerissa, no! Then Morthadim thrusts his sword into her stomach. She lies lifeless. Averian takes a knee, as in he drops to one knee. During the Ruins of Prophecy chapter on top of the Tower of Prophecy. Morthadim then turns and faces Averian and Emilia. They engage in battle.
	Averian locked blades with Morthadim once again. He was barely able to roll away as Morthadim’s scythe cut through the air he was just standing in. Behind him, he heard footsteps running up the nearby stairs. He risked a glance at the entrance. Emilia, Riandan and Nerissa charged out of the tower and stood by Averian’s side…
	Riandan charged Morthadim in a hopeless attempt to save Nerissa. He raised his sword, but Morthadim easily deflected it with his scythe. He grabbed Riandan by the throat without hesitation and lifted him into the air. Before Averian was able to cry out, Morthadim embedded his blade through Riandan’s chest. Riandan wheezed out a faint gasp. His eyes turned to ice as Morthadim flung him to the side with his scythe. He rolled lifelessly across the ground.
	Nerissa rose from the ground nearby and screamed, “No!”
	She lunged at Morthadim in a blind rage. He swung the handle of his scythe into her head. Nerissa stumbled backward as Morthadim took hold of the scythe’s sword grip. Averian yelled, “No!” as Morthadim plunged his blade into Nerissa’s stomach. Her face filled with horror as she gulped in her final breath. Morthadim withdrew his blade as she fell to the ground. Her eyes rolled back into her skull as her body became still. Morthadim turned to Averian and Emilia. He sneered smugly at them.
	Averian fell to one knee and looked briefly at the ground. He took a deep breath as he rose to confront the evil in front of him. No one else. He thought to himself. No one else dies today.
	“Morthadim!” he shouted. “Tell me this: why? Why do all of this?” …
