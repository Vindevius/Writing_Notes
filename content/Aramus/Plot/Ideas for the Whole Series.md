- [ ] Disconnect the powers from the races. Maluculi rarely have any abilities. Lazari and gorcins tend to have high populations of magic users, but not everyone can. Humans are relatively small.

I've known his name since the 1st battles. Why didn't I tell you? You never asked and his name isn't that important. It just means death. Sure that's creepy, but what else can you expect from a spawn of Malefic?" "What do you mean he's a spawn of Malefic?" "Well, did you think he was always this way? No. He was an elf just like me. He was a dark elf, but he's not even that now. There's an ancient power in the Depths of Wraithmoor called Malefic Aldun. That's where he became Morthadim, a spawn of the Malefic. I say spawn, except he controls them. Morthadim is much older than I am, but he once went by another name. His old name is hid from me."

- [ ] [ ] •Morthadim is an ancient praevaltus dark-elf. His original name is Lunisian (Son of the moon). Lunisian bathed in the waters of enhancement (Praeveros) in the Eternal (Aedais) Mountains near Mathoni. It's where all Praevaltus Elves were originally created.
