Morthadim is an ancient lumifor (originally). His original name is Lunisian (Son of the moon). Lunisian bathed in the waters of enhancement (Praeveros) in the Eternal (Aedais) Mountains near Mathoni. It's where all Praevalin Elves were originally created. He became a tenilari soon after when he entered the Fires of Torbanum (Abisusolas) within Torbanum. Even after that, he entered Malefik Aldun (Devil Deep) in Wraithmoor and became Morthadim (Death), Niduxan te Malefik (General of Devils).  
  
Lunisian was born Vivium 7, 525 in Sulicus to two 1st generation elves and was raised uprightly. He was a wonderful kid. He was born on the first day of spring under a lunar eclipse. His parents named him Lunisian, meaning son of the moon. On his 20th birthday, Vivium 7, 545, he traveled to Praeveros, per a newly established elven tradition, to bathe in its waters. He did so and was empowered with even more wisdom and knowledge. He was the top of his class and excelled at all he did.  
He quickly increased in rank and even founded the Elven Fortress within the Darkened Woods (Nebris Durlas) when he was 39 in Anius 564. He was one of the first to find the Leaden Hills, and curious as he was, explored them deeply. In Anius 584, he discovered Torbanum and entered it. He felt power within its halls, but it was unusually silent. As he crept down its main staircase, a legion of monsters came from behind and chased him further into the Abyss.  
Eventually, he came upon Abisusolas, and out of curiosity, entered it. Immediately, he shifted into a monstrous dark-elf with violet eyes. Lunisian turned around, vanquishing all the monsters in his path with newfound power. He returned to Nebris Durlas, where he became angry with his fellow elves and stormed out of his fortress.  
He headed north, eventually coming across Wraithmoor in Anius 588. There he became known as the Necromancer of Wraithmoor. He dabbled in dark magic and became twisted in his dark path. He built up Wraithmoor Fortress around Malefik Aldun, which he studied intently. He learned much from the Abyss at the heart of Wraithmoor, but he didn't dare enter it yet. He learned of the Malefik there, the powerful demonic entities that roamed the land. They intrigued him, so he sought power over them. He studied them patiently for 32 years till Anius 620.  
Near the end of that year, he entered Malefik Aldun, thus entering the land of the Malefik. He fought ancient Malefik one on one using only his wits and the dark power which he had acquired over the last 36 years. He conquered the Supreme Malefik of the time: Moxian. After he did this, Moxian and all the other Malefik bowed to him. He then became Morthadim (Death), Priduxan te Malefik (General of Devils). When he exits Malefik Aldun, it's his 100th birthday, Vivium 7, 625. 5 years had past while he was in there. He also left Malefik Aldun 3 feet taller and his skin had turned into a leathery gray.  
In between Anius 625 and 635, he tested out his newfound power and cast extreme darkness over Wraithmoor. At the end of this time, scouts spotted him in Wraithmoor and he decided it was his time to expand his power. He cast those scouts away from his territory and created golems along with his personal dragon, Nebriswraith to protect his kingdom of Wraithmoor.  
He traveled to Torbanum in Anius 644, and using the power of the Malefiks under his control, overpowered the armies of Monsters and organized them into his own army after killing them and bringing half of them back. He placed Lazera, chief of them all, as their general, with Aveslio the lion as well. Between, Anius 644 and 664, he built up his army. In Anius 664, this new army was unleashed upon the land, becoming a scourge to Aramuania.  
He became a Veteri Praevaltus Vivium 7, 725.  
In Anius 754, Morthadim set off to take over Aramuania. In 763, he increased his efforts, destroying whole cities. In 772, a major defeat at Wilddeep Acropolis destroyed half of his army of Death. Morthadim went into hiding and secretly built up his army until 852, when they reemerged. In 875, the war heightened into the Aramuania-Monster War. In 882, Morthadim sent the Drakon, a new creature, to terrorize the land. His army was once again defeated in 885 and they scattered.  
The scattered remnants of his army continued to harass the Defenors until 4225, when they came out of hiding. Morthadim was finally killed in Anius 4245 by Alexander Newman. He lived 3720 years. After his death he became a Malefik known as Maxunium. He is the Supreme Malefik until he is defeated in Anius 5174 or Stelanius 24, at the death of the emperor of Valoris. His being lived a total of 4,649 years. 929 years as Supreme Malefik
