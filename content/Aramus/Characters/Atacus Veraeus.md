Atacus freely betrays Pridurlas and opens a portal into Pridurlas during the fourth book, allowing Xurex and the Khegra into the fort. Veridex is forced to kill Voralis at this time. After they find Veridex is the traitor, they ask how he got the Khegra into the fort before he dies. He says it wasn't him. Soon after, they find out it was Atacus. He flees before they can stop him. After this, he willingly is killed and brought back by a tenimesor.
