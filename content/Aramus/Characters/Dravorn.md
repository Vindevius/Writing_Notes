Dravorn is responsible for the partial corruption of Almedin into a Voidrend. Dravorn was turned into a Voidrend when a malefic was destroyed, instead of just a corudrax. This allowed him to keep his intelligence, while gaining the abilities of a voidrend. He consciously destroys corudrax to create more voidrends for his ever-growing pack. His pack currently has 17 members.
