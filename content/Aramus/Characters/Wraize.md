“They’ll chant my name!”  
  
Creates portals for the most random things. For instance, to scratch his back.  
  
During Flames of the Forest, Wraize is sent back to warn Hieruma Watch when the chaos begins. He can’t return due to the enemy setting up anti-portal areas. Alex sees a portal appear near him, but it looks like a flat plane of violet light. It's shielded. Corudus portals still work. Praevaltus portals are blueish white. Corudus portals are violet. Later, he comforts Lily when Veridex tells them of Doron's beheading. Possible relationship there? Down the road of course.
