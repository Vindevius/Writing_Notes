Stream of Consciousness  
Questions to ask:  
What is their family dynamic? (How many members, how do they interact, etc.)  
Was their childhood happy or troubled?  
Where did they grow up?  
Were they rich, poor, middle class?  
Who are their friends and how did they meet?  
Were there any traumas in their lives?  
What are some of their happiest memories? Worst memories?  
Why did they choose their career?  
How many romantic relationships have they had? Were they good or bad? Why did they end?  
What is one thing they would wish to change about the past?  
  
Developing a Personality  
What are their biggest fears?  
What are their interests, hobbies, and passions?  
What things and people do they like best? Dislike?  
What makes them angry?  
What makes them sad?  
What makes them happy?  
How do they cope under stress?  
Do they act differently around friends than around family?  
Are they introverts or extroverts?  
What do they want most? (In family, in friends, in a lover, in their career, in life in general.)  
That last question is one of the most important. Understanding what your characters want out of life can create conflicts (for example, the character stepping on toes to reach a goal), dictate and explain actions, and determine how they interact with the other characters.  
  
Character Descriptions  
Behaviour  
Gestures, habits, and tics are very much a part of character description and should showcase a new aspect of personality. If your readers become familiar with a character’s gestures, they will know when they are angry, anxious, or happy without you spelling it out for them.  
Symbolism  
Symbolism is an element of character description that can be fun to play around with. You can use indirect suggestion through imagery to give readers a hidden clue or message.  
Dropping symbolic Easter eggs is not only fun for you, but also for your more eagle-eyed readers.  
Questions to ask to define a character’s appearance  
Hair and eye color? (Basics, but classics.)  
Any “flaws”? Scars, crooked nose, etc. (Don’t make all your heroes look like movie stars: that isn’t very realistic.)  
What’s their body type? Skinny, lanky, short, pudgy, etc.  
What are some of their physical habits? Do they twirl their hair, wring their hands, stand with hands on hips? (Think about people you know and observe those you don’t to help you come up with ideas.)  
What gestures do they use when they are happy, sad, scared, angry, etc.?  
  
Flashbacks  
Flashbacks can be presented:  
As a dream.  
Through a character reminiscing in their head.  
As its own chapter, with a date or some sort of prefacing line to indicate that we’re in the past.  
In the middle of a chapter narrative, and written as if it is happening in the present. In this case, the memory is often in italics to differentiate it from the “present” of the main storyline.  
Any of these methods can be effective. The key is selecting the right memories for a flashback.  
What is their defining moment?  
What moment had the largest impact on who your character became?  
No matter how you do it, the key is making your readers feel like they’re living in that flashback scene and ensuring the flashback teaches them something new and vital about the plot or the character.  
  
Character Exposition  
Reveal small bits of background and conflict. Don't overuse. Remember the possible use of a flashback later. Revealing characters in a scene is much more powerful.  
  
Painting a Character Portrait  
Eye color typically doesn't matter  
This is especially true when the characters already know each other. Why would they be describing their physical attributes?  
Don't stop to describe your character.  
Intersperse them in action scenes. Don't rattle them off like a bullet point list  
Small reminders help.  
Insert little reminders about their appearance throughout the story.  
  
  
How to Make Readers Fall for Your Characters  
Tip #1: A personality trait can have layers. Ask why your character behaves a certain way.  
Tip #2: Ask yourself if making your readers view the story solely from one character’s perspective might allow them to experience the story on a more personal level.  
Tip #3: Don’t make your lead characters too similar, but make sure their talents balance and complement each other.  
Tip #4: If you have a superhuman lead, balance them with a character with whom readers can identify.
