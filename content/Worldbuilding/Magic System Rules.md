Magic with consequences  
Knowing what it can and cannot do  
Consistency and Thoughtfulness  
Culture of the world/worldbuilding. Elari vs Humans.  
Raise the stakes when fighting with magic. It isn't a gunfight.  
Don't break the rules you've set. Sanderson did this well in the Mistborn series. Loopholes, not straight breaking rules.  
Don't info dump the magic system. Have it come in piece by piece.  
Soft magic system to a Hard magic system  
Give it intentionally, not easily  
Foreshadow the magic's possibilities before doing something the reader had no idea could happen. It feels lazy. It needs to be more than a page beforehand.  
Don't make novices experts by the end of the book. It must be earned.  
Consistency! There needs to be a reason why we haven't seen elements of the magic before they're revealed and why they couldn't have been used. Otherwise, the story falls apart.  
Magic has limits. There needs to be some form to it.  
Be able to see this magic system in the real world.
