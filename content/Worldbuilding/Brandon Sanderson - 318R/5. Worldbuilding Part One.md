[[Sanderson's Law]]
0. Always err on the side of things that are awesome. What is going to be awesome? Find a way to make that logical.  
1. An author's ability to solve conflict with magic is DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL to how well the reader understands said magic.  
2. Limitations > Power  
	The limitations of a magic system are more interesting than its capabilities. What the magic can't do is more interesting than what it can.  
3. Expand on what you have already, before you add something new.  
	"A brilliant magic system for a book is less often one with a thousand different powers and abilities -- and is more often a magic system with relatively few powers that the author has considered in depth."  

- ### 1st Law, Promises & Payoffs
- Understand what the magic can do
- Show character and setting while explaining the magic.
- Make a promise and pay it off.
- Make it fun
- ### 2nd Law
- Work with what powers they have.
	- The limitations and costs are much more interesting than what the powers are.
- 3 stories
	- characters aren't experience enough with their powers
	- the magic isn't working currently
	- the magic can't solve this problem.
- ### 3rd Law
- Put in what you need and go in depth with those few items. Less is better in this case. Depth, not a bunch.
