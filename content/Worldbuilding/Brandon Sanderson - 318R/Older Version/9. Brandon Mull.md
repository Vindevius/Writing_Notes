#### Characters
Make them: Relatable, give them wants (why they do it), obstacles/uncertainty, overcome flaws, emotional response, likability. A set up with a payoff.
Daydream about your characters and get to know them. Consistency helps them feel real.
#### Relationships:
As the characters matter more to each other they matter more to the reader.
Characters and relationships bring life into the story.
Daydream and observations. Two major accomplices.
#### Trouble:
Small troubles can matter if the character makes it matter. Make things to be interested in.
Three Act Story simplified:
Act 1: Get your character up a tree.
Act 2: Throw rocks at him.
Act 3: Get him down from the tree.
#### Decisions:
People don’t always do the smartest thing.
#### Consequences:
Characters cannot choose their consequences. They must feel honest and real. Characters must earn their good consequences. 
#### Creative Judgement:
Have creative judgement. This means you know when something will work, and something will not. This also helps create your storytelling voice. That is what publishers pay for. Don’t bore people.
