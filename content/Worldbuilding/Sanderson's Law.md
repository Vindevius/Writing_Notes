Sanderson's Zeroeth Law: Always err on the side of things that are awesome. What is going to be awesome? Find a way to make that logical.  
Sanderson's First Law: An author's ability to solve conflict with magic is DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL to how well the reader understands said magic.  
Sanderson's Second Law: Limitations > Power  
The limitations of a magic system are more interesting than its capabilities. What the magic can't do is more interesting than what it can.  
Sanderson's Third Law: Expand on what you have already, before you add something new.  
"A brilliant magic system for a book is less often one with a thousand different powers and abilities -- and is more often a magic system with relatively few powers that the author has considered in depth."

Train yourself to write good books, not to write a good book. Treat it as you would treat being a pianist.  
  
Put your character's linguistic quirks in your character's thoughts.  
  
Have some philosophy with your fantasy.
