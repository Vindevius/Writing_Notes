The Well of Creation (7 Rings - well of wishes)  
•The main well before the splintering. It was contained (Vitruvius caused a limit to be placed so the user could not use it more than once) until Thorvald's wish splintered the well into seven separate wells.  
•Located on Esderrus at the center of the 7 Rings until the Splintering.  
  
The Well of Strength  
•Uncontained, under Imperium control.  
•Originally located on Esderrus in the 7 rings in place of the Well of Creation. After the defeat of Thorvald, it, along with the other Wells, was moved to Donovus, where its power was dispersed.  
  
The Well of Eternity  
•Originally located at the center of the 7 rings within the Well of Creation until the Splintering. It was then transported to Regalis to the west. After the siege of Regalis, it is buried under rubble to avoid Thorvald finding it.  
•It allows glimpses into eternity. Both the past and the future. Malvolia Tanda gains her power from it and is captured for her abilities.  
  
The Well of Wisdom  
•After the Splintering, it was transported to Libertas Arcem, the capital of Borealis. It is next to the grand palace. It decided to have the Well of Travel transport all of the wells away from Thorvald except the Well of Power. Borealis uses it to stay free from the Imperium.  
•It has the power to give wisdom of any kind to those who use it.  
  
The Well of Nature  
•After the Splintering, it was transported to the east, where it created the barren wasteland of Death's Solitude to hide the Well of Travel. It was then sent to the south, creating Nox Perpetua to hide itself.  
•It allows the user to have power over the forces of nature themselves. It can grant any wish that applies to nature.  
  
The Well of Volition  
•After the Splintering, it was placed in Arxia. They use it to give their troops inspiration for a short amount of time. They cannot make the abilities last without using the Well of Volition in conjunctIon with the Well of Strength.  
•The Well of Volition can inspire anyone with confidence. It can also grant the ability to inspire others up to a certain amount. It can also put this ability into a device but to a lesser extent than if given to a person.  
  
The Well of Life  
•During the Splintering, Thorvald unintentionally used it in conjunction with the Well of Strength to create Lupeons. After the Splintering, it was moved to Murus, next to the southeast portal. They used it to create dragons to protect them from the Imperium.  
•It can create all manner of animal and plant life. It is used to create dragons, drakes, drakons, satyrs, and werewolves. They also use it to give their troops extraordinary healing abilities for a short amount of time. They cannot make the abilities last without using the Well of Life in conjunctIon with the Well of Strength.  
•It can heal any injury or ailment. It can also grant the ability to heal up to a certain amount. It can also put this ability into a device but to a lesser extent than if given to a person.  
  
The Well of Travel  
•After the Splintering, it transported all other Wells, with the exception of the Well of Strength, to various locations as directed by the Well of Wisdom. It transported the Well of Nature with it to create Death's Solitude. It then transported the Well of Nature to its current location. It sits in the middle of the barren Death's Solitude.  
•It can be used for instantaneous travel to anywhere. It can also be used to transport itself. It can also move other portals around when used in conjunction with the Well of Power.
