Why is Mastering Dialogue Crucial?  
It's important because dialogue:  
helps make each character distinct  
enables you to propel plot in varied ways, not only through expository narration  
is a great tool for showing, building, or resolving conflict between characters, which in turn helps create tension and release.  
How do you know when dialogue is good?  
It avoids info dumping  
Great dialogue has this enticing, ‘eavesdropping’ quality. it's simply too interesting to ignore.  
Practical Steps  
open one of your favorite books, one you know well, to a conversation between characters.  
Ask yourself  
How does the author create "the texture of lived life"?  
How are the characters’ voices different from each other (tone, vocabulary, favorite expressions and idioms)?  
How does this dialogue impact the plot?  
What new, useful information do we have by the end?  
  
  
Developing Plot Through Dialogue — Without Info Dumping  
Tips for avoiding info dumps in dialogue  
a) Rewrite info dumps as arguments  
Conflict makes dialogue lively. It’s also useful for showing power struggles and differences of attitude and opinion between characters.  
b) Rewrite as a comparative conversation  
Have your characters compare information for the facts.  
c) Have one character oblivious to the plot detail shared  
d) Rewrite expository dialogue as expository narration  
Practical steps  
Write a deliberate info dump.  
Then rewrite the same exchange four times:  
Once as an argument.  
Next, as fact-comparing dialogue.  
Thirdly, make one character not know the bad news.  
Lastly, rewrite the plot exposition as narration, not dialogue.  
May the above ideas help you strain out expository lumps, leaving only smooth, flowing dialogue.  
  
  
Subtext in Dialogue  
Subtext allows you to write conversations between characters about events your reader does not yet understand.  
So how can you use subtext well in your own writing?  
1) Build up to future plot reveals  
In Munro’s example, the early dialogue in the story implies that Doree goes to visit a man sometimes (“the first two times”), only later revealing it is Lloyd. The subtext of these conversations — Lloyd’s deed and its aftermath — is hinted at through references to his emotional response to the situation as well the strangeness Doree feels seeing him.  
2) Reveal characters’ feelings and  
preoccupations  
Through the subtext of her dialogue with her therapist, it’s clear that Doree is looking for answers and understanding regarding her husband’s actions. Although she does not mention the murders explicitly, in hindsight we understand the significance of the dialogue with her therapist more.  
Practical steps  
Summarize a passage from a favorite novel, first looking at the literal content of the conversation. What, on the surface, are the characters talking about? Next, write down your impressions of the subtext. What does it tell us about these people, and what plot developments could it foretell?  
After you’ve done this, write your own brief piece of dialogue.  
  
  
Developing Character and Plot Through Conflict in Dialogue  
Conflict in dialogue adds to tension and suspense; it shows the complications encroaching on your characters. It’s essential for giving a good character-driven story that ‘texture of lived life’ mentioned in the first lesson.  
Great dialogue doesn't just illustrate the conflict itself — it can be used to show how your character responds under pressure. This helps drive the plot, as we form an inkling of how characters will react to further tensions.  
Conflict-based dialogue deepens characterization  
Conflict in dialogue illustrates its underlying causes  
Conflict in dialogue pushes the story towards a new event horizon  
Gestures and physical description deepen conflict in dialogue  
Whether you’re writing a spat between lovers or a scrap between protagonist and villain, the principles are the same:  
Expand and illustrate details of characters’ personalities and desires  
Use contradictory dialogue to bring to the surface underlying character differences (of desire, values, or goals)  
Use conflict in dialogue as a catalyst that propels your story to new events  
Remember to deepen the conflict with gestures and/or the occasional physical description.  
Practical steps  
Take a passage of dialogue from a book you enjoy where conflict features. Ask:  
What does the conflict (and how characters respond to it) reveal about their mutual personalities?  
How does the author convey the underlying causes? Is it direct, through words alone? Or is there exposition between words, revealing the characters’ unspoken feelings or assumptions  
What new development does this dramatic exchange make possible?  
How has the author used additional details, such as gesture and physical description?  
  
  
Mastering 'Voice'  
A character's 'voice', their distinctive way of speaking, may reveal:  
Personality  
Current mood or psychological state  
Background  
Key differences between them and other characters. These differences may be the seeds of attraction or repulsion  
A character doesn’t have to speak like the snake Kaa from Disney’s The Jungle Book to convey malevolence or sneakiness. Wickedness can arise out of the fact they speak almost exactly like a ‘good’ character but carry out sudden, alarming acts of violence.  
Even so, think about differences in how characters express themselves. Varying regional accents, slang, or culturally specific idioms will give your story a more diverse, believable cast.  
Practical steps  
Pick up a novel that contains different human and non-human races (such as a high fantasy novel) or that includes characters from different cultural backgrounds. Flip through and find dialogue. Ask:  
How (if at all) does the author make characters’ voices different?  
Do some use slang more than others?  
Are characters’ accents/vocabularies different?  
Is one character a chatterbox and the other more silent? Note all identifiable differences.  
What do the details of how characters express themselves, such as their favorite expressions or the attitude with which they say things (e.g. sarcastically), say about them?  
Exercise  
Imagine two characters from radically different countries, cultures, or mythological races. Write a few lines of dialogue between them, about anything. Let your imagination run wild. Just focus on making each character’s voice unique. Is each character kind-natured or cruel; proud or timid? How do you express this in their speech without directly telling the reader these details.  
  
  
How to Use Accents and Dialects in Dialogue  
Yet accents easily become clichés, reinforcing stereotypes, too. You wouldn’t find a contemporary pirate off the North African coast, for example, saying ‘me hearties'.  
This is an important detail: Dialect is tied to geography. If your setting is largely midwestern USA, for instance, readers will likely be confused by a character who shows up with a British Cockney accent if there is no explanation for it.  
Another problem with dialect and accent in dialogue is that it can be used to stereotype characters, diminishing them to reductive national flavors. Accents in novels are offensive when they are used like exotic condiments to ‘spice up’ the writing. They have the danger of reducing characters to tokens of culture, of an exotic ‘elsewhere.'  
How do you avoid the pitfalls of using accents in dialogue?  
Giving different groups different ways of speaking can highlight the diversity of your story’s cast. Using accents and multiple English grammatical patterns can highlight issues such as the challenges immigrants face when they attempt to integrate into a dominant local culture and language.  
Conveying regional differences is a minefield for causing offense. Yet if you use grammar to treat these differences subtly rather than engaging in exaggerated caricature, each character can have a complex and authentic (rather than reductive) voice.  
Practical Steps  
Write your own job interview between a native English speaker and someone who is learning the language but not yet fluent. Choose a language that has different grammar rules. For example, French has plural adjectives (e.g. ‘whites hairs’), whereas English does not. Find a list of these grammar differences online and use some in the second-language speakers lines to show your characters’ different backgrounds.  
  
  
How to Pace Your Dialogue  
Dialogue isn’t an exact replica of real speech: Think of pleasantries we exchange out of social custom (e.g. ‘Hi, how are you?’ and ‘Fine thanks, and yourself?’) Cut meaningless fluff out so it doesn’t slow your story down.  
The faster you want the pace to be, the more you should limit extraneous information: As Holly Lisle writes, “in the height of an action scene it’s a good idea to focus on your main characters’ movements, and emotions as they encounter challenges and obstacles.”  
When you want the pace to be fast and tense, condense. Keep every word focused on the issue at hand.  
Limit your use of dialogue tags. Use line breaks to show changes in speaker and occasional dialogue tags or physical description to show additional subtext.  
Make characters interrupt each other sometimes, especially when the conversation is urgent or emotions run high.  
Practical Steps  
Pick up a novel you’ve recently read, and find dialogue where there is some urgency or tension involved. How often does the author use dialogue tags (he said, she said)? What other details contribute to the flow and pace? Are the sentences simple or complex; short or long?  
When you’ve taken note of these details, imagine a tense situation. Perhaps characters are stuck in an elevator, or soldiers see a rival force approaching. Write this conversation and see how taut you can make the pace.  
  
  
Anchoring Dialogue with Setting and Narration  
Setting is important to consider when writing conversation between two characters. This is because setting:  
May constrain what can be said (for example, two characters who have urgent news to share will be freer to converse on a sidewalk than in the middle of a church service).  
Alters the way characters speak (for example, characters visiting thunderous falls will likely have to shout to be heard over their environment).  
Practical steps  
Copy a few lines of dialogue you particularly enjoy from a favorite novel (and a paragraph or two before and after). In your word processor, highlight speech in one color, and any narration before, during or after in another. How has the author used the characters’ surroundings in their speech? Whose viewpoint is this scene-setting filtered through? (This exercise itself is helpful when applied to your own dialogue.)  
Now take an extract of dialogue you’ve written in response to the exercises in the previous emails. Rewrite it with snippets of preceding and interrupting narration that involves the setting, anchoring your dialogue in place and time. This will help you work dialogue more naturally into your story.  
  
  
Advice on Writing Dialogue From the Experts  
1. Say it aloud as you write it  
Dialogue is aural by nature. How do you write speech that just feels right?  
Practical steps from this advice: When you have a section of dialogue, record it into a dictaphone or a voice recording app on your phone. Listen back to it. Where does your attention wane? Consider cuts to tighten your dialogue.  
2. Don’t use adverbs in dialogue tags as a crutch  
In Conversations with Toni Morrison, the acclaimed author had this to say about using the adverb ‘softly’ to convey quiet speech:  
“I never say ‘She says softly.’ If it's not already soft, you know, I have to leave a lot of space around it so that a reader can hear that it's soft.”  
For example, another character might lean in closer. Or else, you could describe a soft sound between lines of dialogue that one would only hear if a conversation was quiet itself.  
Practical steps from this advice: Write a hushed conversation between two characters. Create the space, the setting, and the halo around what’s written that tells us the conversation is quiet. As an exercise, don’t mention explicitly that their voices are hushed. Focus on other means.  
3. Avoid strange verbs in dialogue tags  
Practical steps from this advice: Take a passage of dialogue you’ve written and remove all dialogue tags. See how much you can clarify who the speaker is through formatting and the placement of actions (for example: She turned from the window to face him. “Is that what you really think?”)  
4. Make dialogue fit its purpose  
Practical steps from this advice: Take a passage of dialogue that you feel is a bit on the long side. Speak it out loud. Cut sentences short as you speak, if you feel it would improve the flow.  
  
  
Wrapping Up With Five Dialogue ‘Rules’  
Rule 1: Avoid clunky info dumps  
Exposition is important. Dialogue is a useful vehicle for letting readers know key plot details. However, dialogue is also best when it contains concise narration as opposed to too much exposition. Reveal plot points through arguments and surprises: it feels hollow and obvious when characters share information they both know already, clearly for the reader’s benefit.  
Rule 2: Remember to use subtext for foreshadowing and subtlety  
Sometimes characters do say things as obvious and literal as, “Our marriage is falling apart,” or “I’m a ruthless social climber and I won’t stop till I’m at the top.” Yet often these details can be carried by subtext, for subtler dialogue. A husband and wife argue about trivial things, for example, and their body language and physical placement is distant. An ambitious employee has conversations with co-workers implying others’ ineptitude. Dialogue has the power to infer as well as tell, so remember to use it.  
Rule 3: Use conflict and voice to illustrate characters and their differences  
Conflict between characters in dialogue reveals their opposing viewpoints, goals, or assumptions. Include conflict as well as the subtle and more overt differences between characters’ voices. Together, they will help you distinguish characters’ competing (or coinciding) desires and objectives.  
Rule 4: Avoid writing phonetic accents or dialogue tags that read as unnatural  
Over the top, phonetically written accents can seem phony at best and culturally offensive at worst. It’s safer to examine grammatical and other differences between languages — the types of errors second- or third-language speakers would actually make — and use them in moderation.  
Similarly, excessive and exotic dialogue tags make speech in writing less believable. Balance formatting (starting a new line for a change in speaker) with movements or gestures (and simple ‘she/he/they/we said’). These ways of identifying speakers in your dialogue ensure your characters don’t read like a sound library of zoo animal samples.  
Rule 5: Pay attention to the pace of your dialogue and balance it with narration  
Pace in dialogue is important. In a tense scene, characters speech shouldn’t be as meandering as War and Peace. Make sure sentence length, structure, and complexity suits the character speaking and the purpose of the dialogue in question.  
Also balance dialogue with narration, and use setting description where necessary to anchor your characters’ conversations in place and time.
